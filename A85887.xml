            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He many high Expectations, great Attempts, diſmaying Dangers, and heavy Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theſe Times, have been the occaſions and ſubjects of many and extraordinary Prayers: What the Conſequences of them have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, all do or may ſee, and ſome do ſeriouſly and ſadly lay to heart.</p>
            <p>The multiplyed unhappy Variances which have broke out and gone on among us, whether ariſing from difference of Judgments, or from diverſity of private Intereſt (for from thoſe two Heads do they all, I think, derive their riſe) have ſet men buſily upon all ways and means of counter-working one another. Among all the means that have been layed hold on in thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conteſtations, Prayer hath been one which all parties have had recourſe to, and much employed. And no marvel, for where men uſe it aright, it is a taking
<pb facs="tcp:169943:4"/> hold on Almighty God, an engaging of him unto them, and to their Cauſe; it is a procuring of him to be their Coajutor or Patron; or a devolving of their whole matter into his hands: and where it is not uſed rightly, it yet ſtandeth people in ſome ſtead, in as much as in the ſight of men it putteth upon that way whereunto it is annexed the ſhew and promiſe both of Juſtice, and of hopefulneſs to prevail. So that among all the means to be taken up, it is like the Helm in the Ship, or like the Spring or Maſter-wheel in any curious Artifice, of chiefeſt place and ſervice. And being ſo, the more pity it is that either it ſhould be ſet on work to a wrong purpoſe, or, being well employed, ſhould meet with any let: the miſemployment of it is a high abuſe; and the miſcarrying of it is of ſad conſequence.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs this holy Engine of Prayer hath of late among us fallen under preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice both theſe ways. That it hath been miſemployed by ſome parties in relation to their proper quarrels or deſigns; that it hath come ſhort of its end in relation to many publique concernments, there can be but few (I think) that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:169943:4"/>
            <p>Among the many Afflictions of the days, there are theſe two very croſs and ſorrowful Occurrences which have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prayer; <hi>Diſcord,</hi> and <hi>Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Diſcord</hi> in the putting up of Prayers; there hath been in reference to many and great Affairs prayer againſt prayer. And <hi>Diſappointment</hi> in the event of Prayers; the Lord hath pleaſed in ſundry particulars to walk contrary to the earneſt, ſolemn and continued prayers of his people; either by denyal, or by delay. And who can ſufficiently lament? who can throughly explicate the Reaſons and Remedies of theſe evils? By the former, what ſcandal redoundeth to Religion? what obſtruction to Prayer it ſelf? for while we cannot agree upon things to be asked, how ſhould we expect that God ſhould accord in mercy to grant? By the latter, what perplexity, ſorrow and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement redoundeth to the people of God? And by both, what diſhonor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth to the Name of God?</p>
            <p>When the Caſe is thus, it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a ſpecially ſeaſonable and needful, a profitable and acceptable work to undertake the Vindication of Prayer from both, or either of thoſe Prejudices:
<pb facs="tcp:169943:5"/> only if there were an Undertaker, and a performance ſuitable to the undertaking.</p>
            <p>The Redemption of Prayer from the latter of thoſe two Prejudices (that which ariſeth from <hi>diſappointment</hi>) is the drift of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Platform of Gods Ways in reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or hiding himſelf from the Prayers of his People which are of a right and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular frame; the Reaſons, and Remedies thereof; with Rules of Direction, and Comforts appertaining to ſuch a Caſe, and divers other Points incidental to a Subject of this nature, are here endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be drawn forth of Scripture, and brought home to the preſent ſtate of the Church of God in theſe places.</p>
            <p>A worthy Enterprize, you will ſay; but by whom taken up? and how mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? there is no place for commendation either of Author or Work. The former only deſireth, and will think himſelf well if he obtain, that his excuſe be accepted for his undertaking this weighty and high Task. The latter is ſubmitted to the free cenſure of the Reader without Apology; only with this precaution: If the meer uſefulneſs and gratefulneſs of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with a poſsibility that ſomething may
<pb facs="tcp:169943:5"/> be in it pertinent thereto, and to the drift propoſed, will not invite thee to peruſe, and prevail with thee to cover many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in it, thou mayſt lay it down ere thou begin with it.</p>
            <p>The Authors Apology for his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſhortly is: He hath took it in hand upon a ſpecial occaſion, and call (as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it) given him, which is related in the end of the Chapter. There are upon him (as ſome of his Chriſtian Brethren do know, and have ſometime put him in mind) certain ſpecial engagements to the prayers of the people of God (and to the God that heareth prayers) for divers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table benefits evidently received by means thereof. And, as he taketh occaſion hereby to acknowledg it, ſo he conceiveth it one of the ſuitableſt ways whereby he may make a return of his gratitude both to God and them for the ſame, if he might be (in the leaſt degree) a Helper of their joy, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in and about their prayers. Further, when firſt he was moved to, and entertained the thought of this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, he was under a reſtraint from the exerciſe of his ordinary publique employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore deſigned to improve his ſaid vacancy to an eſſay upon it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb facs="tcp:169943:6"/> he knoweth not of any other hand that hath taken up this Subject, which (if it had been) might have diſcharged him from it: the want whereof, as it hath made his work the more difficult, (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to walk in an untrod path,) ſo he hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it may help to extenuate his defects in it. Laſtly, he hath conſidered, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this weighty Caſe is not (as he deemeth) duly minded, and layed to heart, his weak aſſail of it may excite Chriſtians to take more notice of it, and may alſo occaſion ſome ſufficienter hand to take up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of it. And being that in all Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and handy-works there is a proceſs from imperfect beginnings unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In Studies a plain Alphabet goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a perfect Skill: In manual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhips there is a rough-caſt firſt, then an exact poliſhing: The Carpenter applieth to his timber, firſt his ruder tools, and then his Rule and Chiſel. So in this Subject, his unexpert handling may excuſably, and not without ſome ſervice, make a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtep to a more exquiſite treaty of this Subject. This is his Apology.</p>
            <p>For the manner of handling the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he hath labored to be plain, not only in ſtile, but in things ſpoken, by dealing
<pb facs="tcp:169943:6"/> home, and laying aſide all partial and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile reſpect of perſons; and particularly in the diſcovery of ſome of the Reaſons of the Caſe he hath to open: And this he hath done not without need and ſpecial warrant. When it was with <hi>Judah,</hi> as now it is with <hi>England,</hi> there was in them an <hi>approaching unto, ſeeking of God dayly,</hi> but without the expected ſucceſs,<note place="margin">Iſai. 58.1.</note> ſo that they came with that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? wherefore have we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledg?</hi> The Lord ſent his Prophet to them with this ſpecial charge; <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voyce like a Trumpet; and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſin.</hi> If any prejudice or peril come thereby, he hath caſt it up, and commended it unto the care of him <hi>unto whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the iſſues from all dangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath in his intention dedicated it to the uſe of every praying Chriſtian that pleaſeth to look it over; but more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly to thoſe of his proper charge (the Pariſhioners of <hi>Eccleſton</hi> Pariſh) and to thoſe of his acquaintance in the County wherein he liveth, and of any other place
<pb facs="tcp:169943:7"/> that call upon the Name of the Lord: And for that Reaſon, having an eye to ſo many at once, he hath omitted the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Dedication of it.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, for no other reſpect but for the Subjects ſake it prayeth (if thou wilt read) thy ſerious and religious peruſal; and let it have, withall, thy prayers for a bleſsing upon it; and therein alſo remember him, who is,</p>

                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2.34, 35.</note> 
                     <hi>and for a ſign which ſhall be ſpoken againſt: yea, a ſword ſhall pierce through thy own Soul alſo, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</hi> We muſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169943:10"/> take theſe words of his to <hi>Mary,</hi> either to be adjoyned to the bleſſing he had pronounced upon them, or to be the very form of bleſſing wherewith he bleſſed them. If the former, they give us to underſtand what a Commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or connexion of Croſſes, there is with the greateſt Bleſſings the ſervants of God can receive in this life: They were happy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to have ſuch a <hi>Child,</hi> and yet that Child muſt in ſome reſpects be a <hi>Benoni,</hi> a ſon of extream ſorrow to them, or one of them, by the very unhappy uſe and uſage he ſhould meet with in the world. If the latter (which is to me more probable) it may ſeem at firſt ſight to be a ſtrange kind of Bleſſing, which conſiſts for the moſt part of exceeding ſad events to befall both Son, and Mother, yea and many others. <hi>Behold, this Child is ſet for the fall—of many in Iſrael; and for a Sign that ſhall be ſpoken againſt: yea, a ſword ſhall pierce through thy own Soul alſo.</hi> So that <hi>Mary</hi> might as much muſe at this Bleſſing, as ſhe did at the Angels Salutation, of which it is ſaid, <hi>She was troubled at his ſaying, and caſt in her mind what manner of Salutation this ſhould be.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk 1 29.</note> Be it ſo, yet the Holy Ghoſt calls it a Bleſſing, and a Bleſſing it muſt be. Yea we may obſerve (and for that end here I bring it in) It is not only their Bleſſing, but a Pattern or Platform of the Bleſſing of all the Faithful, wherewith the Lord endoweth them here on Earth. <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169943:10"/> form of Benediction upon <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> is a draught of the Lords conſtant method of beſtowing, and bringing about Bleſſings to his people. Look how <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpeaketh to them, ſo the Lord proceedeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his; namely, by contradictions, and conflicts; by offences, and ſcandals; and by heart piercing ſorrows to bring them to happy enjoyments, comforts, and mercies. And that which is here deſigned to be the lot of <hi>Christs Perſon,</hi> is alſo to be extended to his <hi>Office, Word, Truth, Way, Cauſe, and Church;</hi> they are with him, and he in them ſet as a ſtone of ſtumbling, and Rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whereat many ſhall fall, and thereby catch their ruine; and as a But or Mark (as the word is interpreted) at which proud and malicious men ſhall dart their ſharpeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and into which they and their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhall thruſt their bloodieſt ſwords: and theſe their injuries and ſufferings ſhall wound with bittereſt griefs all their Alies, that is, all thoſe that in affection and profeſſion adhere unto them. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Patriarch came by his Bleſſing, <hi>The Archers ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and hated him, but his Bow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp;c. by the hands of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God of Jacob, &amp;c. who ſhal bleſs thee with bleſſings of Heaven above, bleſſings of the deep that lieth under, bleſſings of the breſts, and of the womb, &amp;c. they ſhall be on the head of Joſeph, and on the crown of the head

                  <p>BUt, there is another thing which I aimed at in prefacing this of <hi>Simeon;</hi> and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169943:11"/> is the effect which he foretells, the falling of many at <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a ſtumbling block, the bent of mens tongues againſt him, as the ſcope of their malice, and the ſwords piercing through the Soul of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhould have, to wit, <hi>that the thoughts of many hearts may be Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Afflictions, eſpecially thoſe of the Saints, and more eſpecially thoſe that come upon them by the perſecuting Sword, they cauſe great ſearchings of heart. This Sword, as it worketh impreſſions of fear, and grief in the heart, ſo it cauſeth expreſſions of Truth from it. It is a Key to unlock, open, and bring forth the abundance of the heart, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was kept in. It gives vent to, and draws forth thoſe <hi>deep waters</hi> of <hi>the counſels of mans heart:</hi> It anatomizeth, or rips up all the otherwiſe concealed intents, drifts, and diſpoſitions thereof. What great heart-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries doth it make on all hands? It lays open both friend, and foe; it unfolds the heart both of Patients, and Agents; yea, and of the Dependents and Allies of them both; yea, and of meer Spectators. We need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Inſtance then thoſe Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> related to in this place, eſpecially when they came to a head, at his Paſſion and Death; Then did thoſe his Enemies, the <hi>high Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Elders,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pariſees, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> with his <hi>Soldiers</hi> (who before durſt not do what they would, and were ſometimes fain to ſpeak him fair) ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169943:12"/> in their colours. What inveterate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, deſperate Blood-thirſtineſs, ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Injuſtice, deviliſh worldly-policy, immune Cruelty, inſolent Blaſphemy, did then ſwell, and burſt forth of their hearts? Then alſo did the rottenneſs of his falſe and feigned Friends appear: Of <hi>Judas,</hi> by ſelling and betraying him, his Maſter: Of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who erewhile had followed and admired him, and but a few days before had entertained him with triumphant Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s as their King; they now diſplay their hypocriſie, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <hi>Barrabas</hi> before him; by their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt him, <hi>Away with him, crucifie him;</hi> and by their wilful taking upon them the guilt of his Blood. Nay then did the paſſers by, and by-ſtanders, take occaſion to ſhew their ſpleen, by railing and ſcoffing at him. Yea, one of his very fellow-ſufferers muſt, with his life, breathe out his impotent rancor, by reviling him. Then did alſo his faithful Friends and Followers diſcloſe what was in them, and that both ways; both the evil, and the good: On the one ſide, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſcovered their weakneſs of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſlowneſs of Faith, about the Neceſſity, End, and Fruit of Chriſts Death, and Certainty of his Reſurrection, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream deſpondency of mind, and ſome of the chiefeſt of them bewrayed, moreover, ſtrange inconſtancy, fear, and falſhood. On the other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169943:12"/> ſide, there brake forth ſomewhat of the truth and power of grace in them, to wit, in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the other women that followed Chriſt, in the Apoſtles, in <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and in the good Thief upon the Croſs; in them were manifeſted honeſt reſolutions, and much tenderneſs of affection, with ſome degree of faithfulneſs, piety, and courage. Laſtly, in our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf there was a diſcovery made. In the midſt of all thoſe his inexplicable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durings and agonies, <hi>his heart (being with them melted like wax in the midſt of his bowels)</hi> did ſend forth the moſt precious oyntments,<note place="margin">Pſa. 22 14.</note> and ſweet ſmelling ſavours of the graces treaſured in him above meaſure; and among other, admirable and ſurpaſſing Love, Meekneſs, Patience, Fortitude, Charity, Obedience, and Faith oriently ſhined forth in him: So fully did this diſſecting effect of the Sword in all ſorts of perſons then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>And there hath been of late no ſmall veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſame in and amongſt our ſelves. That which was once complained of as the caſe of <hi>Judah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 4.10.</note> hath been made good upon us, to wit, <hi>the Swords reaching unto the Soul.</hi> It hath reached unto, yea and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through the Soul of theſe three Nations, in regard of their publique Intereſts; beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it hath run through the Soul of many, and many a particular perſon in them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169943:13"/> of life, or of other things dearer to them then their own lives: and this Soul-piercer hath been a ſhrewd Heart-diſcloſer. As when that holy King and Prophet <hi>David</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of his Kingdom by the rebellious ſword of his own ſon and Subjects, the hearts of men did diverſly diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards him: One ſhewed himſelf a traytorous <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> another a raillng <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> another a ſelf-advantaging <hi>Ziba,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſeditious <hi>Sheba;</hi> others (as the <hi>two hundered which went with Abſalom out of Jeruſalem in their ſimplicity</hi>) are ſeduced from their <hi>Loyalty:</hi> others ſtand faſt, and approve their fidelity (though ſome of them are miſ-repreſented to <hi>David</hi>) as <hi>Zadock</hi> and <hi>Abiathar, Ittai</hi> and <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> So hath it come to paſs amongſt us: Our eyes do now behold all theſe parts acted, as the ſeveral iſſues of mens hearts, drawn forth by this diſſecting Sword. O what Ambition, Deceitfulneſs, Malice, Covetouſneſs, Diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Cruelty, Carnal-policy, Mutability, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in Religion, Perfidy, and Perjury in Covenants and Oaths?

                  <p>IT is beſides my preſent purpoſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the decyphering, or cure of all, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe unhappy heart-maladies even now named; the moſt of them are too dangerous Ulcers for me to deal with: ſuch a Spittle-ful of running, raging ſores, require the view and applications of a whole Colledg of the ableſt Phyſicians. It is enough if I admove my hand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169943:14"/> to the moſt gentle and curable amongſt them. There are ſome of them are the taintures and griefs of the godlieſt, uprighteſt men: ſuch as in the aforementioned tryals, the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the faſteſt friends of <hi>David,</hi> yea and <hi>David</hi> himſelf was ſubject to thoſe, both deſerve more pity, and promiſe more hope of recovery: Such are, wearineſs in the ways of God; failing, and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart under the ſmart of worldly troubles and diſappointments; diſtruſtful thoughts, doubts and reaſonings about the Promiſes, and Providences of God, and the like. My deſign is to apply my ſelf (did I know how) unto ſome of the ſervants of God, laboring under, or in danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by theſe evils; <hi>To ſpeak</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet bids) <hi>to them that are of a fearful</hi> (or haſty) <hi>heart,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is no new thing, that the hearts of men truly gracious and holy, under diſaſtrous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, do manifeſt ſome perverſity, or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; It hath ſcarce ever been otherwiſe with any ſuch in that condition.

Jer. 25.15.27. &amp; 8.18 Lam. 1.20, 22.</note> in ſo much that <hi>their feet are almoſt gone, their ſteps are well nigh ſlipt.</hi> The Judgments of God are a <hi>Cup</hi> of which <hi>all muſt drink;</hi> and the potion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it makes the wicked <hi>drunk,</hi> ſo that <hi>they ſpue, and fall, and riſe again no more;</hi> ſo it bringeth upon the ſoundeſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God <hi>qualms,</hi> and <hi>ſick fits,</hi> and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry painfully digeſted by them. It is in a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Soul as in a Bee-hive; If you ſtir, or thruſt any thing into the hive, preſently all the Bees come forth; the honey ſtays with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but the ſtinging Bees ſwarm out: So, if ſuch a Soul be pierced with that perſecuting-ſword that entered into <hi>Mary</hi>'s Soul, the corruption in it makes iſſue, and comes forth, whileſt the graces and vertues lie hidden, and couched down within. As in Nature, when the heart is violently affected, either through any ſudden paſsion of the mind, or noxious humor in the body, the blood and vital ſpirits retire inward, and betake themſelves to the heart; the outward parts are poſſeſſed with weakneſs, paleneſs, trembling, and diſtortion: So you may obſerve in the ſpiritual Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; Let vehement troubles aſſail a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, and you may find, not ſeldom, and eſpecially in the firſt onſet, that in ſuch a one infirmities and corruptions are forward to break out; and the good that's in him to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169943:15"/> be ſlow of vent, or benummed, and ſhut up in the Center. The Examples of the Servants of God in Scripture thus carrying under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, the obſcurement and overcaſting of their graces and good principles, and the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their frailties, are more and larger then I can allow my ſelf to lay forth. How much in this kind is recorded in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, of thoſe great names, and renowned Saints, <hi>Job, David, Heman, Ethan, Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Jonah,</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> may eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered: The bitter Complaints, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelming Horrors, the deep Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the high Expoſtulations, the perverſe Judgments and Concluſions, the Infidelity, Wrath, Impatience, and Deſpondency, which they have bewrayed, are too ample a Subject for me here to expatiate on. Some perhaps will preſume, thoſe imperfections and over-cloudings were peculiar to that time of the Churches Minority, before the Goſpel times; but, now ſhe is come to more maturity under the Goſpel, the Saints are overgrown thoſe diſtempers: But this can in no wiſe be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

                     <note place="margin">Job 9.10, 11, 22, 23, 24.</note> that is (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) thoſe that are willing and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to know and judg of the acts of divine Providence, wherein ſometimes he <hi>alike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked,</hi> the good and bad: <hi>Sometimes he laugheth at the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the innocent</hi> (or is pleaſed to try them with afflictions,) and <hi>the Earth</hi> (mean while) <hi>is given into the hand of the wicked,</hi> (or wicked men have allowed them by him an abundant portion of earthly things.)

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169943:17"/> artifice of it being a wheel within a wheel, is the portraiture of divine Providence about the affairs of the world, and eſpecially of the Church, and more eſpecially of the Church in the furnace of hot Perſecutions, (as at the time of this Viſion ſhewed to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhe was,) and it pointeth out to us the myſteriouſneſs of the courſe of Gods Providence towards his Church in that eſtate: The quickeſt, moſt ſearching eyes cannot therein diſcry the tract and purpoſes of divine Diſpenſations; there are in them ſo many croſs turnings, ſo many cloſe involations and intricacies: The effects produced, to wit, the evils ſuffered, are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſenſe, and quickly enough apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſecondary means by which they come do oft-times appear; but the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them is, as they come from God: What are his reaſons for which, what his ends to which, what his mind and affection with which, he doth them? Theſe are the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are always, and preſently raiſed, by the Patients upon them; and they are no leſs commonly raiſed, then difficulty determined or cleared. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſhua) what ſhall I ſay when Iſrael turneth their backs before their Enemies?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſh. 7.8.</note> That diſaſter quite amazed Heroick <hi>Joſhua;</hi> he was at his wits end; he was ſo puzzled at it, that he knew not what to think, what to ſay of it. Nay, ſometimes the perplexed Soul goes further in its queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and demands concerning God, Where
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169943:18"/> is he? doth he ſee, or regard? is he mindful of his promiſe? where are his former loving-kindneſſes? and the like. Such clouds are ſpread upon the face of Gods ways in this particular; and ſuch vapors do ariſe out of mens muſing minds to increaſe the obſcurity, that here, <hi>he that feareth the Lord walketh in darkneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 50.10 &amp; 59.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and gropeth for the wall like the blind, he gropeth as if he had no eyes.</hi> And hence doth the Faithfuls diſtemper of heart take its riſe; this darkneſs worketh upon their corruption, or rather their corruption upon it: Unto the weight of that evil that lies upon the outward man, the heart creates it ſelf, and ſuper-addeth a burden of doubtful, ſolicitous, and vexing thoughts, about the Lords doing in it; and thus that condition is turned into a temptation, or occaſion for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful infirmities to make head, and boil forth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Cauſe may be the hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which is made of the adverſe events of the faithful; the heavy cenſures and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe judgments that are paſſed upon them. The Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that had much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both of this demeanor of men towards him, and of the working of it upon him, (by cauſing a heart-riſing or ſtirring of corruption within him,) he beginneth one of his Pſalms (penned on ſuch an occaſion) with theſe words: <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 41.</note> or, as ſome render the place, <hi>Bleſſed is he that is underſtanding upon</hi> (or towards)

                     <hi>Bleſſed is he that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelf wiſely towards the afflicted.</hi> To carry wiſely, or prudently to look upon him that is caſt down, or brought low, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to mind, and ponder the Lords mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that his hand upon him; and, out of a quick ſenſe of his, and our own community of condition, both in regard of deſert of, and ſubjectneſs to ſuch calamities, to forbear all harſh judgings of him; and, in ſtead thereof, to miniſter wholeſom advice, and ſeaſonable comforts to him: And the benediction, that he pronounceth upon ſuch deporters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, intimateth the ſingularity or rareneſs of this carriage. The more ordinary intreaty that perſons in that eſtate meet with from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is, a load of raſh, uncharitable, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cenſures: Men, preſently, condemn them as impious, conclude them to be grand offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and diſgorge upon them the blackeſt of their conceits; they think no brand foul enough for them. As <hi>David,</hi> being in this caſe, ſaith, <hi>They caſt iniquity upon me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.3.</note> as people are wont to caſt dirt, or any filthy ſtuff, at an infamous lewd perſon that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to publique ſhame. Or, as <hi>Job</hi>

                     </note> and publiquely authorized by the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> had brought the Empire low, and had taken and ſacked <hi>Rome;</hi> the Enemies of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity accuſed it as the cauſe of thoſe miſchiefs; which occaſioned S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to write that his work <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> as an <hi>Apology</hi> for Religion, and a Refutation of that Obloquy. I might go on to parallel this way of mens aggravating the ſufferings of the Church by ſlanders, and ſuch ſmitings and woundings with the tongue, in the Papiſts, like handling
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169943:20"/> of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and latter reformed Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; and in more modern recent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by profeſſedly Antipapiſtical, but really Popiſh hands; but I forbear, upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Fact.</p>
                  <p>Now this is no ſmall tryall of Chriſtians Equanimity: It can hardly be eſcaped, but that it will ſomewhat ſtir the ſtomack, and move the patience of the afflicted, when their adverſities are made their crime, and that which is one of their beſt ſupports under their ſufferings, their innocency, is taken away from them, as far as cenſure can do it. For the moſt part the Faithfuls troubles come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them becauſe they dare not, know not how to run a courſe of wickedneſs with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: this then is a very hard caſe, that when men ſuffer becauſe they dare not ſin, they muſt be ſaid to ſin becauſe they ſuffer. This uſage of <hi>Job</hi> by his friends (of which even now) exceedingly battered his ſpirit, and drew from him high language, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtempered in his conteſtation with them: <hi>How long</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>will ye vex my Soul, and break me in pieces with words? Theſe ten times have ye reproached me, &amp;c. Have pity upon me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 19.2, 3, 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>O ye my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me. Why do ye perſecute me as God, and are not ſatisfied with my fleſh? q. d.</hi> The ſcourge of God being layd thus ſmartly upon me, it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you to pity me, and not to arraign and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169943:20"/> condemn mine Integrity; and, if you will take pleaſure to rake in my wounds, my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſufferings ſhould ſuffice, and glut your cruel delight; and you ſhould ſpare my Soul, and ſtate of Conſcience, which is peculiar to divine Cognizance.</p>
                  <p>I the rather take notice of this incentive of Corruption in the Saints under preſſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, becauſe, I am perſwaded, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much practiſed, at leaſt never ſo <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> or Magiſterially made uſe of as now it is. It is now become a current proof, yea one of the chiefeſt Topicks, or Common-places, from which men draw their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the perſons and cauſe of their diſtreſſed oppoſites, and for their own juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This argument hath been ſo artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned, ſo imperiouſly conſigned, (and, which is more) ſo ſmiled upon, and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſubſequent events, and obſervations; that, although in true divinity it be but meerly fallacious, and even with rational men it hath been denyed admiſſion among probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet it now ſeems to paſs as demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: Yea, it is at preſent grown a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mixt with ſome indignation, that the continued diſappointments and miſcarriages on the one part, and the conſtant ſucceſſes following, if not out-going, the deſigns and expectations of the other, do not convince all men. It is beſides my buſineſs to diſcuſs this Argument; there hath been enough ſaid to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169943:21"/> it: And, if the Evidence of Scripture, and the experience and acknowledgment of all ſound Judgments, in all Ages, will not caſt off the ſcales of ſome mens minds againſt the preſent ſenſe of worldly advancement; a little time, with the turn of the tyde, may poſſibly do it. Coſmographers obſerve, That, though the common courſe of the Sea to be ebb and flow every twenty four hours, yet there is a place in <hi>Affrica</hi> towards the <hi>Equator</hi> from whence the Sea flows continually towards the Eaſt. This Sea is not the figure of a worldly condition. If <hi>Affrica</hi> can ſhew ſuch a wonder in Nature, no place can yield the like in Civil Affairs: There never was any where a continual afflux in temporal attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Theſe know a Weſt, as well as an Eaſt; an ebb, as well as an increaſe: And thoſe that fix their anchor, or bottom the equity or approveableneſs of their way upon this Argument, may ride at full Sea; but when it ebbs they ſhall be left on the ſand, and their own Argument ſhall ſerve to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The nature of the ſufferings of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Church of God: The Meaſure, Multitude, and Multiplicity of them. When <hi>the time of their calamity, and day of their viſitation is come; when the Lord cometh cut of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity, and in ſpecial hath a Controverſie with his people, and will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169943:21"/> plead with Iſrael; their miſeries fall heavy and thick upon them, and in various kinds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For their Meaſure, or Heavineſs; They are reſembled to the pains of birth-travel: <hi>What wilt thou ſay, when he ſhall puniſh thee?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 13.21. Lam. 1.15 Lam. 3.15</note> 
                     <hi>Shall not ſorrows take thee as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in travel?</hi> And to the treading of the Vintage: <hi>The Lord hath troden the Virgin the daughter of Judah as in a wine-preſs.</hi> And to a ſad drunkenneſs: <hi>He hath filled me with bitterneſs, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> further repreſenting and perſonating the Churches miſeries in the <hi>Lamentations</hi> ſets them forth as <hi>perfect, admirable, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and <hi>incredible.</hi> 1. Perfect, or compleat: <hi>The Lord hath accompliſhed his fury, he hath poured forth his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</hi> 2. Admirable and aſtoniſhing: <hi>She came down wonderfully: How doth the City ſit ſolitary? how is ſhe become a widow? how is ſhe become tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi> 3. Incomparable and ſurpaſſing: <hi>Behold, and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger: What thing ſhall I take to witneſs for thee? What thing ſhall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jeruſalem? What ſhall I equal to thee, that I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, O Virgin daughter of Sion? For
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169943:22"/> the puniſhment of the daughter of my people is greater then the puniſhment of the ſin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands ſtayed on her.</hi> 4. Incredible: <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the world would not have beleeved that the adverſary and enemy ſhould have entered into the gates of Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And then, for their Number, or Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. In the Churches or Saints day of trouble, or hour of temptation, it pleaſeth God oftentimes to multiply their miſeries, to heap affliction upon affliction, to add grief to grief, and to bring one adverſity in the neck of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The Scripture compareth their evils in ſuch a time to waves of the Sea, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and overtake one another: So <hi>David; Deep calleth unto deep at the noiſe of thy water-ſpouts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.7.</note> 
                     <hi>all thy waves, and thy billows are gone over me.</hi> And to Armies that come in companies and thouſands upon a party: So <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of God; <hi>His troops come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and raiſe up their way againſt me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 19.12.</note> And to a Leaguer that beſets a place on all hands: So the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Lamentations;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.5, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath builded againſt me, and compaſſed me about with gall and travel; he hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out.</hi> And to a feſtival Congregation; as the Church in the ſame Song;<note place="margin">Cap. 2. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt called me as in a ſolemn day my terrors round about.</hi> And to a chain
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169943:22"/> made of many links; as the Church again;<note place="margin">Chap. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath made my chain heavy:</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel; Make a chain, &amp;c. miſchief ſhall come upon miſchief,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 7.23, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>and rumor ſhall be upon rumor.</hi> And to the arrows of a quiver; as the Church; <hi>He hath bent his bow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.12 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſet me as a mark for the arrow; he hath cauſed the arrows</hi> (or ſons) <hi>of his quiver to enter into my reins.</hi> Thus the croſſes of the ſervants of God come thronging in, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, and environing them about on every ſide. I will add but one expreſſion more to this purpoſe, and it is very full one, to wit, that of <hi>Job: I am full of confuſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 10.15, 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore ſee thou mine affliction, for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth; thou hunteſt me as a fierce Lion; and again thou ſheweſt thy ſelf marvelous upon me: thou reneweſt thy witneſſes againſt me, and increaſeſt thine indignation upon me; Changes and War are againſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is then uſually a Multiplicity of ſufferings. The Lords hand goes out againſt them in afflictions, not only heavy for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and many for number, but manifold, or divers for kind. He maketh uſe of variety of ways in dealing thus with them: And that, either, 1. Succeſſively; ſo that when they have avoyded or recovered from an evil of one kind, they are met with by one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind: as in that of the Prophet; <hi>Fear, and the pit, and the ſnare are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the Earth: And it ſhall come
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169943:23"/> to paſs, that he who fleeth from the noiſe of the fear ſhall fall into the pit, and he that cometh up out of the midſt of the pit ſhall be taken in the ſnare; for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the Earth do ſhake.</hi> And in that of the Lord to <hi>Eliah:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King 19.17.</note> 
                     <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that him that eſcapeth the ſword of Hazael ſhall Jehu ſlay; and him that eſcapeth from the ſword of Jehu ſhall Eliſha ſlay.</hi> So the people of <hi>Judah</hi> were parcelled out to ſeveral Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>A third part of thee ſhall dye with the Peſtilence, and with Famine ſhall they be conſumed in the midſt of thee; and a third part ſhall fall by the Sword round about thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 5.12</note> 
                     <hi>and I will ſcatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a ſword after them.</hi> Or, 2. At one and the ſame time: Sometime it ſo befalleth the ſervants of God, that at once afflictions come upon them from God, from Man, and from Satan; that they are troubled both in Body and Soul, both within and without at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes they have God immediatly, Man and Satan at once againſt them: ſo it was with <hi>Job,</hi> Satan ſtood up againſt him, and accuſed him to God, and upon licenſe obtained, ſmote him in all kinds (death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) and in this condition he was afflicted immediatly of God, he hiding his face from him, and ſhewing the tokens of his anger againſt him, ſo that he cryes out, <hi>The arrows
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169943:23"/> of the Almighty are within me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 6.4:7:13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>the poyſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirits, the terrors of God do ſet themſelves in Array againſt me, and when I ſay my bed ſhal comfort me, my couch ſhal eaſe my complaint, then thou ſcareſt me with dreams, and terrifieſt me through viſions.</hi> And, being thus, men alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his tormentors, as he often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and particularly in one place he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, how many ſorts of men did aggravate his trouble; <hi>His brethren, his acquaintance, his kinsfolk, his familiars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 19.13. to the 20.</note> 
                     <hi>and inward friends, his menial ſervants, his own wife, and the young fry of little children.</hi> In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he deſcribes at large what a rabble of abject miſcreants aſſailed him.<note n="*" place="margin">Job 30.1. to the 15.</note> And this is often ſeen, when the Lord layes his hand upon any of his, then Men and Devils come in upon them; Men, that is, the vulgar ſort, and eſpecially the profeſſed enemies of God, and godlineſs, do then let ſlye at them, both with tongue and hand; with the ſcorn and deriſion of the one; and with the Rapine and violence of the other. <hi>Job</hi> hath an elegant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this, <hi>Becauſe he</hi> (to wit God) <hi>hath looſed my cord, and afflicted me, they have alſo let looſe the bridle before me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 30.11. <hi>Beza</hi> &amp; <hi>Diodat in Loc. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. with</hi> Job 12.18.</note> that is, as <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Diodate</hi> pharaphraſe it, He hath looſed the bands of my power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them; and therefore they run riot, and caſt off the reines of ſubjection and modeſty.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:169943:24"/>
                  <p>In like manner, Satan, in what he may, is ready then to put in,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7. 1 Theſ. 3.5.</note> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> both found it in himſelf, in that thorn in the fleſh, his buffeting meſſenger; and feared it in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> when in his own tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations he could not forbear, but muſt needs ſend <hi>Timotheus, to know their faith, leſt by ſome means the tempter ſhould have tempted them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again ſometimes they are at the ſame time, troubled both within and without, both in ſoul and body.<note place="margin">Pſal. 6.2.3 2 Cor. 7.5.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord heal me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, for my bones are vexed, my ſoul alſo is ſore vexed. We</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) were troubled on every ſide, without were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, within were feares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then being the Dimenſion of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durings of Gods ſervants; ſeeing they often prove to be ſo mighty, numerous, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it is not to be wondred at, if they be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with a kind of ſtupefaction, in regard of the exerciſe of their graces, and be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtempered in reſpect of the acting of corruption. Holy and wiſe <hi>Heman,</hi> being in ſuch a plight of ſorrows,<note place="margin">Pſal. 88.3, 4, 15.</note> was (in his own acknowledgment) <hi>as a dead and distracted man;</hi> as <hi>dead,</hi> in regard of the ſenſe, and uſe of the grace and comfort; and as <hi>distracted</hi> in regard of the fumes of corruption that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded his mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth conſideration, of occaſion helping forward the ſaid effect in the faithful
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169943:24"/> may be the means of their afflictions, or the perſons by whom inſtrumentally they come; and this conſideration may lye two wayes, or, there are two ſorts of men, which not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are imployed in laying on the ſufferings of the Church, and their agency therein may add ſome aggravation to thoſe ſufferings, and exaſperation to the ſpirits of the ſufferers of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes the Inſtruments are of the worſt of men, and very wicked perſons, and this adds to their affliction, and moves their diſcontented paſſions; that ſuch as thoſe ſhould be their ſcourges: ſo the Pſalmiſt makes the Churches complaint. <hi>O God the heathen are come into thine inheritance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 79.1, 2, 3, 6, 7, &amp; 74, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>thy holy Temple have they defiled, they have laid Ieruſalem on heaps, the dead bodies of thy ſervants have they given to be meat to the foules of the heaven, the fleſh of thy Saints unto the beaſts of the Earth, their blood have they ſhed like water, &amp;c.</hi> Again, <hi>they</hi> (to wit, <hi>the heathen that have not known thee, and the kingdomes that have not called upon thy name) they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling place;</hi> and in another Pſalm, <hi>thine Enemies roar in the midst of thy Congregations, they ſet up their Enſigns for ſigns.</hi> This was it with which the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> was ſore agrieved, <hi>The wicked doth compaſs about the righteous,—Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lookeſt thou on them that deal treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes the ſubordinate agents are perſons of neereſt relation, and obligation to the ſufferers, and this cuts to the heart, and exulcerates their ſorrow; when thoſe that are intimately tyed to them by Domeſtical, Political, or Eccleſiaſticall relation; by the bond of Civill amity, or Religion, prove falſe and hoſtle to them: that place in <hi>Zechariah, Behold I wil make Ieruſalem a cup of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling unto all the people round about;</hi>

This wrought upon <hi>Job</hi> more then all his other ſufferings from other creatures, that his beloved friends and brethren not only failed him of their help, but turned againſt him, and added their Reproaches and Conteſtations to the reſt of his miſeries: <hi>All my inward friends</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>abhorred me,</hi>

                  <p>And I dare be bold to ſay, there is many a ſuffering Soul at this day, with whom, next to their own and the Lands ſin, and the anger of the Almighty, this is the thing that ſtrikes deepeſt, lies heavieſt upon the heart, that the evils that are come upon them are the projects and productions of Brethren, not only as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, but as Proteſtants, Reformers, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, Solemn-callers upon God; Aſſociates in the ſame counſels, actions, dangers, mercies; and fair Avowers for the Goſpel, Conſcience, Godlineſs, Purity; for Law, Juſtice, Liberty, Peace; for King, Parliament, Kingdom, Siſter Nations, and all Proteſtant Churches. O the ſorrow, ſhame, vexation, aſtoniſhment, that is upon them for this!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another Reaſon is the difficulty of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in times of great troubles. The office of Patience is in the ſtate of adverſity to keep down, and quiet the tumultuous paſſions; and to curb and ſuppreſs the head-ſtrong corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which that condition is apt to awaken and let looſe: it is then to compoſe the ſpirit, and to contain the whole man within his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now this is no ſmall buſineſs; Patience proves a hard task when it comes in hand. It is but an eaſie matter, when men are in a quiet ſtate, to frame contemplative notions of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the mind, or to diſcourſe of them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to behold them upon others, or to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169943:27"/> foreſee them coming on themſelves: But the matter is to endure them when they are come; then comes in the part of Patience. <hi>Patience</hi> is not an intellectual comprehenſion of Good Rules, or a ſpeculative diſcerning of the equity, neceſſity and profit of afflictions; but a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical uſe of ſuch Rules in bearing; or, a real and regular ſuffering; and this is ſomewhat to do. He is in the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> his account a perfect and entire Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Jam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he would produce the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Evidences of the truth of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical calling among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who (it ſeems) vilified his perſon, and queſtioned that his Calling, he mentions patience for one proof: <hi>Truly the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought among you in all patience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.12.</note> 
                     <hi>in ſigns and wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi> Whereby he gives us to obſerve, that patience (eſpecially all, or compleat patience) is a vertue ſeated in the higheſt form of Chriſtians, and ſomewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative of an Apoſtle. A learned Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor conjectureth of <hi>David,</hi> that the 73 Pſalm (wherein he confeſſeth how he was offended and ſtaggered,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Foord</hi> in Pſal. 49. &amp; 73.</note> and what envy and impatience he was tainted with at the wickeds proſperity, and the afflictedneſs of the godly) was written by him when he was yet but young; whereas the 37 and 49 Pſalms (wherein he profeſſeth his quietneſs and unmoveableneſs at the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the wicked, and adverſity of the righteous, and teacheth the ſame to others)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169943:27"/> were penned by him when he was grown old, and thereby attained to be a veterane Souldier in patience. Common experience tells us, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive grace is much more difficult to get and uſe, then active: as it is more ado to travel in a deep or craggy way, then in a fair and ſmooth road: as Seafaring men find it is an otherwiſe labor to ſail in a ſtorm, then in a calm. The exerciſe of active grace conſiſteth either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good, or in communicating the good endowments we have to others, or in reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſuperfluities; but theſe things are much more eaſie then to bear the want of good, the preſence of evil; and to lay down ourſelves, and reſign up our very Being.</p>

                  <p>THus at length I am come home to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Subject; this laſt Conſideration hath brought me to it, <hi>viz.

                  <p>And it comes upon them both by their own ſenſe and obſervation, and the exprobation of their oppoſites: In regard of the former they are like <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who going with child of prayer powerful <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhe ſuffered a ſtrugling within her 'twixt him and <hi>Eſau,</hi> a rough and profane perſon; in ſo much that ſhe ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.22.</note>

                  <p>Let this caſe be put as it really is, with all its conſiderable Circumſtances and Ingredients, and it will be found a very remarkable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Caſe. 1. The obſervation of many hath been, That a more then ordinary ſpirit of prayer hath been poured out upon Chriſtians of late; and that out of it a great multitude of prayers have been poured forth in relation to the publique Concernments. 2. That there hath been a general Conſent and Concurrence, not only of Chriſtians in theſe Nations, but of all the Proteſtant or Reformed Churches under Heaven, in prayer for the ſame Concernments. 3. That the effect of their prayers that have gone before us, and are now with God, hath broke forth, and begun to be reaped by us of this age. 4. We of theſe Nations, beſides
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169943:30"/> dayly and perſonal prayers, have ſet to it in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſeeking unto God, with Faſting, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and Confeſſion of ſins, publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, on ſtated days, and occaſionally; and have continued in this courſe now divers years. 5. We have added to ſuch our prayers, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Vows, Oaths, and Covenants, for the things prayed for, and heaped them one upon another. 6. The ſubject matter of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have been (1.) Such things as we are not only commanded to pray for, but to give a principal place to in our prayers, to wit, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Reformation, Propagation of the Goſpel, and Kingdom of Chriſt, Deliverance from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Enemies, and Inteſtine Conſpirators, and the Upholding of our Fundamental Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt all Innovaders, with the ſafety and conduct of our ſupreme Magiſtracy and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: (2.) Such benefits as the promiſes of God in his Word are underſtood to lay up and reſerve for his Church in theſe, or the near fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing times. 7. There hath been the uſe of other lawful means, with ſtrong endeavors, and hazards therein, for the accompliſhing of the things prayed for; and very hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and firſt fruits thereof erewhile at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; yea and a door ſet open to, and a near view of, and approach to, yea even almoſt an embracement of, the main of our deſires. 8. There hath been (no doubt) a ſincere aym, and an upright frame of heart in many through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all theſe things. 9. Laſtly, To all theſe Conſiderations we may add the Promiſes of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169943:31"/> God made in Scripture to them that call upon him; with the uſual efficacy, and experienced prevalency of prayer with God. Now if we compare theſe particulars about the putting up, and proſecution of our prayers, with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (on the other ſide) that hath followed; the preſent unaccompliſhment of thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the events that have enſued directly croſs and thwart thereunto; it will appear a caſe of ſerious moment, very needful and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remarked and diſcuſſed in order to manies reſolution and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I have here taken in hand to ſay ſomething to it; not that I dare promiſe, or hope to ſound the full depth, or traverſe the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it; but to put it into the Remembrance of others more able, and to ſet the Enquiry before them, and a little to begin and break the way into it for them: And this I really do (that I may confeſs what may help to make me more excuſable in this Undertaking) upon ſpecial inſtance. There hath been put into my hand a Caſe, or Query, of this import by a <hi>Brother</hi> very eminent in his place, in the name of himſelf, and many others, deſiring anſwer thereto; which deſire hath ſince been often renewed: The <hi>Query</hi> was this, both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words: <hi>Seeing God doth hide himſelf from his peoples prayers, grounded (we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope) upon his Promiſes, and ſeemeth by his Providences to anſwer the prayers which are contrary thereunto; I deſire to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Example of it? what may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169943:31"/> be the Reaſon of it? and what <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe ſhould be made of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I had read it, I thought it was no hard thing to ſay that which might ſuffice to clear it, and therefore ſtuck not to receive it; but after, when I had conſidered better, not only of the thing, but of the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from whom it came, and how difficult it is to know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary, and to utter fit, acceptable and right words to one, much more to many, under affliction; and that it is one thing to inform the Judgment, another thing to heal or comfort a troubled ſpirit; I begun to repent of my forwardneſs, and wiſht that I could tell how fairly to lay aſide the Enterpriſe. But the uſefulneſs of the Queſtion, my reſpect to the Propoſer, and over-haſty Entertaining of it, now have engaged me to carry on the Treaty of it, as the Lord ſhall help me: And oh that it would pleaſe him to enable me to ſpeak, both of him the thing that is right, and to men, to his ſervants, that which may be ſound and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion propounded, affordeth matter for four Queries; or, it offereth four things to be diſtinctly conſidered and reſolved. 1. <hi>Whether there be any Example of this?</hi> vis. <hi>Gods hiding himſelf from his peoples pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, grounded upon his Promiſes, and his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Providences to anſwer the prayers which are contrary thereunto?</hi> 2. <hi>How, or in what ſence God may be</hi> ſaid ſo to do?

                  <p>FIrſt, Of the former (viz. <hi>Gods hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his peoples prayers grounded upon his Promiſes</hi>) there is great ſtore of notable Examples of this.</p>
                  <p>I will ſet them down in this order: 1. The Acknowledgments or Complaints of this in the mouths of the people of God. 2. The Declarations of God himſelf to this purpoſe. 3. Hiſtorical Obſervations of the thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Firſt, Of this the Saints or people of God have made their Acknowledgment or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in Scripture. And this is obſervable, 1. Either of the prayers of particular perſons; 2. Or of the prayers of the Community, or multitude of Gods people, that is, of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For Perſonal Prayers: Single perſons have found themſelves in this condition. And this may be noted touching their prayers: 1. For others. 2. For themſelves. 3. For Gods own Cauſe.</p>

Now, betwixt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt of the Ten Perſecutions, and the beginning of the ſeven Trumpets, there was more then the age of a man.

                  <p>Another Prophecy in the ſame Book we may add to this purpoſe; it is that of the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: the Text ſaith, <hi>They ſhall prophecy a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days clothed with ſackcloth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 11.3, 5</note>

Thoſe <hi>one thouſand two hundred and three-ſcore days</hi> they compute to intend ſo many years. That <hi>ſackcloth</hi> they take to emblematize their mourning, complaining condition.

                     <note place="margin">2 Kings. 1 10.</note> 
                     <hi>to conſume the Captains and their fifties.</hi> Theſe perſons, although ſuch precious ones, ſo raiſed up, and impowred by Chriſt; yet, we ſee, they are put to walk mournfully, and pray continuedly, for ſo great a term of years, ere their prayers ſpeed, and their ſtate be changed. Yea, notwithſtanding all their patience, and conſtancy in that ſad and expecting condition, they are at length to be overcome, and ſlain, and kept unburied, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted

But yet the next words will reſolve us, that both their former walking in ſackcloth, and their ſlaying at laſt, is to be no more then a ſuſpenſe, or deferring for a time: for within three days and a half they are raiſed up again to life, to their feet, yea to Heaven, in a Cloud, in ſight of their Enemies; that is, they attain to an happy end of their labours and ſufferings, and to an accompliſhment of their prayers.

                  <p>Being thus paſſed out of Scripture into Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory, I will add out of it a few Examples more, of the overclouding or ſuſpenſe put upon the prayers of the people of God.

Theſe Chriſtians (and the reſt of thoſe times) that were ſo earneſt with God in the behalf of a Papan Emperor, and Civil Cauſe, were as much, or rather more ſerious and fervent (no doubt) in dayly prayer for the Churches Reſt and Enlargement, then under bloody Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they muſt needs be granted to bear a part in the travelling womans pains and cry, afore ſpoken of; as alſo in that cry unto God of the Souls under the Altar at the opening of the fifth Seal, which before alſo I inſiſted on: But, though they did, and were ſo mighty in prayer, and exerciſed thoſe Arms of prayers and tears (which were the Arms which the primitive Chriſtians only owned, as allowable, wherewith to reſiſt the Tyranny of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Superiors, they being then but of a private and plebeian capacity) as diligently as they did their ſecular Arms for defence of the Emperor; yet they could not thereby obtain a preſent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of thoſe fiery Perſecutions,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. p. 44, 45 &amp; Mr <hi>Fox,</hi> vol. 1. p. 67<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> which then had ſo long laſted, but they went on, by times, for above a hundred years longer; and although <hi>Aurelius</hi> (upon the aforeſaid Wonders) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the ſtay of the fourth Perſecution, then on foot, yet was it carried on ſtill by the

                     <hi>they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; thou art neer in their mouth, but far from their reins.</hi> See how their impious piety, and flouriſhing proſperity went along together: You may note here theſe four things; 1. Theſe men, in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and perfidious ways, they were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; <hi>thou art neer in their mouth.</hi> 2.

Let this example (among others) be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by us in theſe ſtumbling times: Though theſe degenerate Brethren of the Prophet take unjuſt and perfidious courſes, yet they pray; and, though they pray in ſuch courſes, yet they proſper: Divine providence ſpeeds them, and ſpeeds them to a high riſe, &amp; with a long tract of ſucceſſes. In the mean time, how fares it on the other hand with the Prophet himſelf their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt? why, to this expoſtulation about them he ſubjoyneth his prayer for himſelf, and againſt

                  <p>But one Example more ſhall I bring for this, and it is a note-worthy one. <hi>Job,</hi> the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Afflictions, accompanied with integre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, maketh this one ſtrain of his adverſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he anſwereth him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 12.4.</note> That <hi>Job</hi> called upon God, and found no anſwer, is expreſſed by himſelf in ſeveral other paſſages of this Book, which I cited before.

                     </note> Yet we may take for certain, that betwixt <hi>Job</hi> and him (whoſoever he was) there was ſome kind of odds or variance; that they both called upon God; and that in their ſo doing <hi>Job</hi> was the juſt upright man, and the other was in the wrong. Yet ſee, <hi>Job</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himſelf to be repelled in his prayer, and his ſcornful Antagoniſt to be heard of God. How he was heard, <hi>Job</hi> explaineth in the next Verſe but one: <hi>The Tabernacles of Robbers proſper, and they that provoke God are ſecure, into whoſe hand God bringeth abundantly.</hi> They were heard (it appears) in temporal iſſues and advantages. But in ſtead of my own, I will preſent you with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Caryls</hi> Paraphraſe on thoſe words. <q>
                        <hi>The Tabernacles of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers prosper.</hi> Robbers are of two ſorts: There are open Robbers, that care not who ſees; ſuch are warlike Robbers, who bring Power to do what they cannot do by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: ſuch were thoſe warlike Bands (and at them <hi>Job</hi> aims in this Argument) of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> who ſpoiled <hi>Jobs</hi> Eſtate and Cattel. By <hi>Robbers</hi> here we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe boiſterous ſons of <hi>Mars,</hi> men of blood and violence, who make their Will their Law, and think they may do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have power to do. Secondly, There are ſecret Robbers: Deceit and Fraud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Robbery, as well as Power and Force.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169943:56"/> Some rob while they pretend to ſeek for right; ſome are rob'd, others are murthered by the Law; the Law is a ſhadow to many lawleſs actions. Others rob ſecurely while they ſeem only to ſell. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaid, <hi>Surely I am become rich, I have found me out Subſtance; in all my labour they ſhall find none iniquity in me that were ſin,</hi> Hoſ. 12.8. <hi>q. d.</hi> I am ſure none can charge me with any open wrong or Robbery; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly that I have done no ſuch thing; for that were ſin, that is, puniſhment would follow ſuch iniquity; whereas I thrive and proſper. Both or either of theſe Robbers may be underſtood here. <hi>They who provoke God are ſecure.</hi> To provoke God is ſinning with a high hand: <hi>q. d.</hi> I do not ſpeak of thoſe who ſin lightly, who trade in ſmall ſins, or ſin after the rate and courſe of ordinary men; but they who ſin provokingly and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they who ſend defiance to Heaven by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even thoſe live ſecurely here on Earth. <hi>Are ſecure.</hi> The Hebrew is abſtract and plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; <hi>ſecurities, confidences are to them.</hi> They ſin againſt God every way, and they have ſecurity every way; they ſin againſt God as much as they can, and they have as much proſperity as they will; all kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is their portion who commit all kind of impiety. <hi>Into whoſe hand God bringeth abundantly.</hi> What the worſt of men have is of Gods giving, he puts it into their hand: Satan puts wickedneſs into their hearts, but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169943:57"/> it is God who puts power into their hands; God puts the perſons and eſtates of others into their hands. <hi>Abundantly.</hi> Our Tranſlators add that, to ſhew the bounty of God even to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, who moſt deſignedly diſobey him: Such have not only as much as they need, but as much as they deſire; God brings Quails into their hands, as well as Manna. <hi>In cujus manus venire facit Deus, ſc. omnia animi ſui vota.</hi> Merc. <hi>Into whoſe hands God maketh to come, to wit, all their wiſhes.</hi> There is another reading, <hi>Who put God into their hand.</hi> The Jewiſh Doctors are much for this; They may be ſaid to carry God in their hand, becauſe they act as if God were in their power and diſpoſe, not they in his. The <hi>Tyrians</hi> chained <hi>Hercules</hi> to a poſt, that he might not depart their Country. This is to bring a God in the hand groſly and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They do it cloſely and covertly, who are unwilling to be guided by his hand. They who would bring God down to their wills make Laws for God: They who make a Law for God, act as if they had made God.</q> Thus hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Caryl</hi> opened theſe words for me: and we ſee of what a large extent the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of an evil mans prayer, in oppoſition to a godly mans, may be.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I produced Examples (of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient variety, and what pertinency mine obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and leaſure would afford) to the thing propounded in both the branches of it: <hi>viz</hi> 1. Of Gods hiding himſelf from his Peoples

                  <p>I will conclude mine Anſwer to the firſt Query with another General Obſervation on the ſaid Hiſtory of <hi>Job:</hi> It is concerning the ſtate of the Controverſie therein debated.

                     <hi>nor any ways ſecond or favor the ungodly.</hi> And particularly in reference to prayer one of them, <hi>viz.

But why do I interpoſe to determine in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? The Lord himſelf doth umpire the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Yet, in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Iob</hi> and his Tenet are abſolved, his Friends and their Cauſe are diſallowed by God.

               <p>WE have granted, and atteſted by many witneſſes, that the Lord doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (and in ſome ſort) hide himſelf from his peoples prayers ſome ways grounded upon his promiſes, and ſeemeth by his Providences to anſwer the prayers that are contrary to them.

                  <p>It muſt be noted further of theſe his peculiar people: 1. Some are in this relation by external
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169943:60"/> vocation, union, communion, and profeſsion only; that is, they are appropriated to God by outward acts of Ordinances and Worſhip, and enjoy external, miniſterial, and temporary priviledges and benefits. The deſcription of theſe in Scripture is; They <hi>are Gods people and Saints, that have made a Covenant with him by ſacrifice:</hi>

Some have, over and above this ſtile and relation, a neerer appertainency unto God, to wit, by inward and effectual grace, calling, union and communion.

The Scripture
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169943:61"/> is induſtrious in diſtinguiſhing betwixt the people of God in the former, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way; and ſhewing the difference which there is between them in ſharing of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Gods people.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the groundedneſs of Prayers upon Divine Promiſes.</head>
                  <p>COncerning the groundedneſs of Prayers upon Divine Promiſes, we are well to obſerve divers things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That prayer unto God hath in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a twofold ground: There is, 1. A ground of precept. 2. A ground of promiſe. There is a ground of Precept, by which prayer is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, and made neceſſary; and a ground
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169943:62"/> of promiſe, by which it is ſupported and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: The precept is the ground of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for the undertaking of it; the promiſe is the ground of confidence, and aſſurance for the ſucceſs of it: The precept ſhews the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for what, and the manner how to pray; the promiſe gives us the inducement why we ſhould pray. Both theſe grounds we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered together in divers places; as in that of the Pſalmiſt:<note place="margin">Pſa. 50.15</note> 
                     <hi>Call upon me in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I will deliver thee. Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> there's the ground of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: <hi>I will deliver thee,</hi> there's the ground of promiſe. And in that of the Apoſtle <hi>James, If any of you lack wiſdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam, 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>let him ask it of God,</hi> that's the ground of precept; <hi>and it ſhall be given him,</hi> that's the ground of promiſe. And in that of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matt. 7.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you:</hi> there's a treble precept, <hi>Ask, ſeek, knock;</hi> and a treble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>It ſhall be given you, Ye ſhall find, It ſhall be opened unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not deny but in ſome kind the promiſe may be accounted a ground of warrant, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for prayer: yea, in ſome caſes it is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant; that is, where the thing prayed for is a peculiar bleſſing, out of the common road:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.16.25 27</note> as was that promiſe of God to <hi>David of a ſure Houſe and Kingdom,</hi> upon which he built his prayer. And that made to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kin. 17.1 Jam. 5.17</note> that <hi>there ſhould not be dew nor rain for ſome years, but according to his word:</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:169943:62"/> whereupon he grounded his prayer mentioned in the Epiſtle of <hi>James.</hi> But the more proper, univerſal, and adequate ground of warrant for prayer, is that of precept. Some things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily may be found promiſed that are not to be prayed for: as the promiſe of retribution of our wrongs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. and that of the not periſhing of one hair of a Chriſtian, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.18. and there are divers things which have been lawfully, and are to be prayed for, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there is no ſpecial promiſe: Such is <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer for <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer for <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer for the Salvation of the Jewiſh Nation of his age, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1. Prayer for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.44. Prayer for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. And the general promiſe of hearing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it doth not conſtantly intend the giving of the thing (as will after be ſhewed) it muſt be reſolved into that proviſo, that the prayer be for a thing warrantable to be asked: The ground of warrant therefore muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the promiſe; and in caſes ordinary is to be primarily and originally fetched from the rule, or precept for prayer.</p>
                  <p>It being a matter of much weight and uſe, to know how to ground prayers aright, and to underſtand what prayers are grounded as they ſhould be, and what are not; it will be requiſite that we take a diſtinct view of both theſe groundworks of prayer: that is, both that of precept, or rule, and that of promiſe; of the one to guide our Conſcience in making,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169943:63"/> of the other to erect our confidence in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and expecting our prayers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of the ground of precept: this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it warrants prayer, and makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, gives us moreover direction about it in two reſpects: 1. What may and ought to be the ſubject of our prayer. 2. How, or in what manner it muſt be put up to God. I ſhall here take notice of it only in theſe two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſubject of prayer is regulated by Scripture-precept; and that, 1. Either in the matter or thing for which, 2. Or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or parties for, or concerning whom, prayer is to be made.</p>
                  <p>In point of matter, or things for which we are to pray, the Scripture gives us precepts. 1. Sometimes generally, or indefinitely, as in that of our Saviour, <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7.7, 11</note> 
                     <hi>ſeek, and ye ſhal find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you:</hi> which indefinite Command is interpreted by the following words to be, not ſimply univerſal, <hi>ask</hi> any thing whatſoever, but circumſpectly univerſal, <hi>viz.</hi> within the predicament of good: <hi>Your Father which is in Heaven ſhall give good things to them that ask.</hi> And the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us ſuch another general warrant for the matter: <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 4.6, 5, 8</note> The Apoſtles eye doubtleſs in this univerſal precept is only upon lawful, ſerious, ordinarily
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169943:63"/> poſſible, and good things; thoſe namely about which the <hi>Moderation</hi> (foreſpoken of) of Chriſtians is to be exerciſed; for whatſoever is otherwiſe, is wholy to be refrained: and thoſe things which preſently after he defines by the characters of <hi>true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, of good report, vertuous, praiſe-worthy;</hi> thoſe are the things to be thought of; yet with Moderation, not with anxious, diffident care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and with a pious recommendation of them in prayer unto God. 2. Yet the precept leaves us not ſo in the general, but deſcends to particulars. It inſtructs us in a multitude of, yea in all particulars to be prayed for: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to deprecate ſuch and ſuch evils, and to ſupplicate and implore this and that good thing. It points us out to Temporals, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and Eternals; to things of body, things of mind, and things of external property and reſpect. I might gather up, and bring in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for every of theſe in particular, as they lie ſcattered in their ſeveral places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But with this I need not charge my ſelf, or my Reader; there is a form of prayer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt and perfect, both for matter and order, taught and commanded by our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which diſtributeth, under ſix Petitions, or heads, the whole ſubſtance of prayer; and under thoſe heads are comprehended all things good, and religiouſly to be deſired: there is in that prayer <hi>ſumma petendorum,</hi> a compleat platform, or groundwork of prayer for the matter: So that look what is reducible to it,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169943:64"/> may and muſt be asked of God; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thing is not comprizable under ſome of the branches of it, is not allowed a place in our prayers. Concerning it our Saviour hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plainly, <hi>After this manner therefore pray ye, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the perſonal ſubject of prayer, or the perſons concerning whom we muſt make requeſt to God: we have in the Word of God Rules, 1. For praying for perſons: 2. For praying againſt perſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The perſons to be prayed for are of two ſorts: 1. Divine; as our Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us in his platform to pray in the three leading Petitions for Gods own immediate concernments, <hi>The hallowing of his Name, the Coming of his Kingdom, and the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his will.</hi> And as he inſtructs us by his Word, ſo doth he teach us by his example to pray, whileſt he himſelf prays, <hi>Father, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy Name:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 12.28</note> and we are directed to this alſo by the practice of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> praying, <hi>That the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be glorified in the Theſſalonians.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.12</note> In this kind of prayer the divine Majeſty is both the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſubject of our ſupplication, and it is peculiar to him ſo to be. 2. The other ſort of perſons to be prayed for are humane; and they are, 1. Our ſelves: 2. Others. 1. For our ſelves, we have many Commands to pray: <hi>Is any among you afflicted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 5.14</note> 
                     <hi>let him pray:</hi> He muſt not only ſend for the Elders to pray over him in his ſickneſs (as it followeth,) but he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169943:64"/> muſt pray for himſelf. And again, <hi>Take with you words, and turn to the Lord, and ſay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> 2. We are alſo to be Petitioners for others; and the extent of our prayers for others is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, 1. Univerſally unto all men: <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all ſupplications,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1</note>

                        </gap>ſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. For all men,</hi> that is, not for all collectively, if we intend our prayer to be for their Salvation, for God hath declared his counſel and purpoſe to be againſt that; and Chriſt our Saviour, in praying for thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, and for all them in order to their Salvation, hath contradiſtinguiſhed them from the world: <hi>I pray for them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 17.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I pray not for the world:</hi> But, either diſtributively, for any, of whatſoever ſort or degree, for one as well as another, as occaſion is offered; or, if for all collectively, then only for thoſe benefits to them which God hath declared to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all: For that ſome perſons are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of our prayers for ſpirituals, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by that of the Apoſtle; <hi>There is a ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.16</note> not for the life (eternal) of him that ſinneth that ſin. 2. In particular there are alſo precepts to pray for others in ſpecial, according to ſeveral ſtates and relations, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Civil, publique and private. The people of God are to pray for the Church of God: <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem:</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, There is ſomething alſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for prayer againſt perſons: Which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well for Explication and Caution, as for Preſcript or Incitation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some are found to pray againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And this hath been done diverſly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the principle whence. 1. Sometimes out of an extraordinary and ſuper-eminent pitch of zeal and charity: As <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Moſes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exo. 32.32</note> 
                     <hi>Yet now if thou wilt forgive their ſin; and if not, blot me I pray thee out of thy Book which thou haſt written.</hi> David: <hi>Let thine hand I pray thee, O Lord,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.3.</note> 
                     <hi>For I could wiſh that my ſelf were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren, my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to the fleſh.</hi>

                     </note> Of theſe Inſtances I ſuppoſe I may ſay they are either ſcarce imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or ſcarce attainable. Obſerve alſo, they are conditional, or comparative; rather this then that; rather then the deſire to which they are annexed ſhould be fruſtrate. Moreover for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169943:66"/> the firſt, it is not eaſie to underſtand diſtinctly what <hi>Moſes</hi> meant by that Book, or by blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; and beſides, <hi>Moſes</hi> was in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary relation and function, he was a typical Mediator. For the ſecond, <hi>David</hi> doth but paſs an equal cenſure upon himſelf, that he that had committed the Sin might bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that only rather then others that were innocent in it, that were a publique com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and the people of God. And for the third; <hi>Pauls</hi> is not a prayer, but a profeſſion what he could wiſh were it a prayable thing: like that profeſſion of his before King <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 26.29</note> 
                     <hi>Festus,</hi> and the reſt: <hi>I would to God that not only thou, but alſo all that hear me this day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds.</hi> But this Sea, this flame of Love (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calls it) breaking forth of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> expreſſeth it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, as to the matter of ſeparation, and may therefore be underſtood of ſeparation, not from the love of Chriſt, but from his Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not everlaſtingly, but for a time only. 2. Sometimes holy men have prayed againſt themſelves,<note place="margin">Job 6.8. Jon. 4.3, 9. Num. 11.15 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Kin. 19.4</note> but it hath been out of raſhneſs and impatience, as <hi>Job, Jonah, Moſes, Elijah,</hi> (I refer to the places quoted for their words and occaſion,) of them I need not doubt to ſay they are left on record for our uſe indeed, but not to practiſe, but to avoyd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are prayers againſt others; and of this ſort there are found many Preſidents, and ſome Commands, which I ſhall diſtinguiſh
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169943:66"/> into ſeveral ſorts, and ſhortly point out the ſence and uſe which (according to judicious Interpreters) may be made of them. The Prayers againſt others are, 1. Either by way of complaint of the wickedneſs or wrong done againſt them by whom they are put up. So <hi>Elias</hi> is ſaid <hi>to make interceſſion to God againſt Iſrael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.2 Acts 4.29. Iſa. 37.14.</note> So do the Apoſtles and Church of God complain in prayer <hi>of the threats of the high Prieſt and his Councel againſt them.</hi> So doth <hi>Hezekiah</hi> make his plaint unto God <hi>of the blaſphemy of Sennacherib againſt God, and his rage againſt himſelf.</hi> And the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> aboundeth with ſuch like prayers. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this kind of prayer there is no doubt or difficulty, but it may and ſhould upon occaſion be uſed by us. 2. Or they are by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation; that is, wiſhing and deſiring the Lord to manifeſt himſelf, and lift up his hand againſt them, in oppoſition to whom they are made: And of this ſort of prayers we muſt yet further note ſome difference. 1. Some are only againſt mens counſels or practiſes; Thus when <hi>Ahitophel</hi> conſpired with <hi>Abſalom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.31.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>O Lord, I pray thee turn the counſel of Ahitophel into fooliſhneſs:</hi> Such Imprecations are without ſcruple. 2. Others are bent againſt the perſons of men; and theſe are alſo differenced into, 1. Such as are not for mens deſtruction, but correction only, by ſome temporal evil or affliction; which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to befall them for this end, that they may be brought to underſtand, humble themſelves,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169943:67"/> repent of their iniquity, and turn to God: As is that of the Pſalmiſt;<note place="margin">Pſal. 83.16</note> 
                     <hi>Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy Name, O Lord.</hi> So <hi>Elihu</hi> is conceived to pray concerning <hi>Job; My deſire is, that Job may be tryed</hi> (or, O my Father,<note place="margin">Job 34 36.</note> let <hi>Job</hi> be tryed) <hi>unto the end, becauſe of his anſwers for wicked men;</hi> that is (as <hi>Diodate</hi> paraphraſeth it) <hi>Do not, O God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thy viſitations from Job, until thou haſt brought him to the duty of a child, and to the only means of obtaining pardon, which is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and confeſſion.</hi> Neither is the lawfulneſs of Imprecations like to theſe ſtuck at by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. 2. Such as are againſt mens perſons, for their ſubverſion; and theſe are of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold nature or Conſideration. 1. Some are againſt men as they are Gods Enemies<note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 68.1 69 2.109.6 Rom. 11.9. Judg. 5.31</note>. 2. Some are againſt men as they are the Churches Enemies<note n="b" place="margin">Pſa. 79.6 137.7 Lam. 3.64 Neb. 4 4</note>. 3. And ſome are againſt men as they are their own Enemies that pray<note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 55.15 59.13 71, 13 Jer. 15.15 17 18 18.21 20.12. 2 Kin. 1.10. 2.24 2 Tim. 4.14</note>. Now theſe three kinds of Malediction are thoſe that are called into queſtion; and that two ways. 1. Whether they were Juſtifiable in them that uſed them in ſacred writ? 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be imitable lawfully in by us againſt the like Enemies? Firſt, For the former Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; The Juſtifiableneſs of them in them that uſed them in holy Writ, is generally aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; and thus cleared. 1. Many of thoſe Execrations may be taken to be uttered by a Spirit of Prophecy, and ſo to be rather Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Predictions, and Denunciations of divine Judgments certainly foreſeen to come upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169943:67"/> the parties, then meer wiſhings and deſirings of evil to them, proceeding originally from the wills of them that pray<note n="d" place="margin">Verba praedicanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantium.<note n="*" place="margin">Auguſt. contra. Fauſtum. idem de Serm. Dom. li. 1.</note> Optativo modo uſi ſunt pro In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicativo.</note>. 2. Others of them, if they came not from a divining Spirit, yet they might come from a diſcerning Spirit, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly given to them; whereby they might be able to diſcover thoſe againſt whom they ſo prayed, to be implacable, and deſperate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, his Church and Truth. 3. The Utterers of thoſe prayers, being Penmen of holy Writ, or otherwiſe extraordinary perſons, may well be deemed to have been moved with a pure zeal of God, and his Cauſe, and clear of thoſe baſe incentives of private paſſion, malice, and impatience, more incident to others. And whereas thoſe prayers may ſeem to oppugn the Rules of charity, and prayer for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; it may be ſaid, Thoſe Rules are to bind where there is no ſpecial Warrant for excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and charity to men muſt be ſubordinate and ſecondary to our love and zeal towards God. 2. But if any vitioſity may be ſuppoſed in any of thoſe Inſtances (as ſome incline to admit in thoſe votes of the Prophet <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">

And <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet.</hi> de prec. c. 16. p. 76.</note>,) ſuch doubtleſs are to be born with in them, and paſſed over by us, without following them therein. Secondly, For the latter Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about them, <hi>viz.</hi> their Lawfulneſs for us to practiſe: This may not ſimply be granted; but we are to diſtinguiſh of the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſuch prayers, which may be, 1. Either generally, or indefinitely; as when one prayeth againſt the Enemies of God and Chriſt, whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169943:68"/> they be, not pitching upon any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and without eyeing or judging theſe or thoſe to be ſuch; but leaving it to God to find them out, and deal with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Of this nature is that of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak; So let all thine Enemies periſh, O Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 5.31</note> And that of the Apoſtle, not only pronounced by him, but impoſed upon others to concur in; <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22</note> 
                     <hi>let him be Anathema Maran atha.</hi> Such like Imprecations keeping within the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral denunciation both with tongue and eye, are not inconvenient for Chriſtians now. 2. Or particularly conceived, that is, perſonally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and fixed on this or that man or people; and theſe Maledictions are to be held unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable for us ordinarily, we having no ſpecial or infallible gift of prophecy or diſcerning, whereby we may be enabled to ſee into mens ſpiritual eſtate, or to foreſee what is abſolutely the portion of their cup from the Almighty, or to dictate unto us ſuch prayers; we falling ſhort alſo of that clearneſs of zeal, and immix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Love to God, which in ſome in times paſt hath been. We having no ſuch ſpecial call or aſſiſtance as others have had, our ſafeſt and cleareſt way is to take notice of that rebuke of our Saviour <hi>unto James and John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 9.55. Mat. 5.44. Ro. 12.14 19. 1 Pet. 3.9. 1 Pet. 2.23 Lu. 23.34 Acts 7.60.</note> 
                     <hi>when they would have called for fire down from Heaven upon certain Samaritans:</hi> And to walk by thoſe Rules which on the other hand are given us in the Goſpel, of <hi>Loving, doing good to, bleſſing, praying for our Enemies, Curſers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169943:68"/> and Perſecutors, and of refraining curſing, ſelf-avenging, and wrong-retaliating:</hi> And for which we have the practiſe of our bleſſed Saviour, and of his ſervants, ſet before us in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>We have thus an Extract of the Rules of Scripture concerning the Subject of prayer, both as it reſpecteth things and perſons. There is yet another branch of this preceptive ground of prayer to be viewed, <hi>viz.</hi> that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the way in which prayer muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and put up to God. This hath included in it two things. 1. The means or aſſiſtance by which we muſt pray. 2. The manner how. Briefly of both.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The means or aſſiſtance by which we muſt pray, this is twofold. 1. It muſt be in Chriſt. 2. It muſt be in the Spirit. We are to make uſe of both theſe by way of Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Advocateſhip. Chriſt maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us in Heaven<note n="a" place="margin">Ro. 8.34</note> at the right hand of God: The Spirit maketh Interceſſion within us in the heart<note n="b" place="margin">Ro. 8.26</note>. Chriſt is our Advocate with the Father<note n="c" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.2</note>: The Spirit is our Advocate abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with and in us<note n="d" place="margin">Jo. 14 16</note>: The Spirit is called <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advocate,</hi> in relation to Chriſt, who is alſo our Advocate: The Spirit is another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe different from him, both in perſon, and in the nature of his Advocateſhip. Chriſt is our Advocate in Heaven by way of Expiation of our ſins, Attonement, Reconciliation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of our perſons, and of our prayers before God: The Spirit is our Advocate here
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169943:69"/> on Earth by way of Inſtruction and Excitation of us to pray, and animating or enlivening our requeſts within us. We labor of a double inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to go to God in prayer. 1. Of guilt and unworthineſs, as being enemies and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors againſt God. 2. Of ineptitude or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, both in point of underſtanding and will; as being both ignorant and liveleſs to ask any thing of God. Wherefore we have need of, and have given us a double Advocate, Firſt, Of Propitiation in Heaven, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; Secondly, Of Interpellation, or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency with and in us; this is the proper work of the Holy Ghoſt: And therefore we are ſaid <hi>to have acceſs unto the Father through Chriſt, and by the Spirit.</hi> The Rule then in this place to be followed, is; We muſt pray, 1. In Chriſt: <hi>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name; Ask, and you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that your Joy may be full. At that day ye ſhall ask in my Name.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, The Manner: There are certain particular Qualifications and Affections that muſt accompany prayer: Thoſe are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, or the main of them. 1. Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14 15</note>. 2. Faith<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 21.22 Iam. 1 6. Rom 10.4</note>. 3.

And laſtly, Perſeverance<note n="g" place="margin">Luk 18.1 Eph. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>18.</note>. I leave the Reader (for brevities ſake) to ſearch the places quoted in the Margin.</p>
                  <p>I have thus given a brief deſcription of the ground of Precept, layd down for prayer in the Word of God: I am now to come to the ground of Promiſe, and to do the like by it.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:169943:70"/>
                  <p>I ſhall, for our ſurvey of this, propoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obſervation two things: 1. The ſeveral kinds of promiſe upon which prayer is to ground it ſelf. 2. The right ſence and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which thoſe promiſes are made, and to be taken by us, in building our prayers upon them; and conſequently of the grounding of prayers upon the promiſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſeveral kinds of promiſes for the bottoming of prayer. The Promiſes of God, upon which prayer may fix and hold, are of two ſorts: 1. Irreſpective, or ſuch as are made of doing good, without any expreſs mention of, or relation to prayer. 2. Relative, or ſuch as are made to prayer, as of hearing, or of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this or that bleſſing upon prayer. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſeth the matter or thing prayed for: the latter promiſeth it unto prayer. So that the former I may term the material, the latter the formal ground of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the irreſpective promiſes, I need not, may not be particular upon them, they are ſo huge a multitude: they make a principal part of Scripture; and, for their nature, they are great and precious; of a vaſt and various comprehenſion; they are extended to all things, times, perſons, ſtates, and uſes: they are by themſelves a ſubject large enough for a whole Treatiſe; and ſo they are put forth by a learned and worthy Author, with much diligence<note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Leigh</hi> Treat. of Divine Promiſes now a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed.</note>. Only I ſhall note one diſtinction of them: 1. They are either ſuch as concern all; are made and propounded, and ſo in ſome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169943:70"/> ſort appertain to all, or any whomſoever, ſo they come duly qualified to them: ſuch are the main bulk, and current of Scripture-promiſes. 2. There are that belong to ſome ſpecial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, who are uſually by name ſpoken to, or of, in them: ſuch was that promiſe made to <hi>David</hi> of a laſting family, and ſucceſſion in the Kingdom over <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.16 Iſai. 38.5</note> and that promiſe made to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> of recovery from ſickneſs, and of an addition of fifteen years unto his life, and of defence of himſelf and the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and, as a ſign of the ſame, of the return back of the ſhadow upon the Sun-dyal of <hi>Ahaz</hi> ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and that promiſe made to the captive <hi>Jews</hi> of a return home from <hi>Babylon,</hi> after ſeventy years accompliſhed in captivity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the relative promiſes, or thoſe that are made expreſly to prayer; they are, as the former, 1. Either peculiar to ſome perſons, as God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> upon his prayer, to ſpare <hi>Sodom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.26 20.7</note> according to the conditions by him inſerted touching the number of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to be there found: and he promiſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech,</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> life, upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> praying for him:<note place="margin">1 Kin. 17 1. Jam. 5.17</note> And he promiſed <hi>Elijah</hi> that there ſhould not be dew nor rain for ſome years, but according to his Word, which was his prayer. 2. Or univerſal, and layd down for all: and theſe are the promiſes now of uſe to us, for the grounding of our prayers upon them: and therefore we are to take theſe into our more ſpecial conſideration. They are all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169943:71"/> general in regard of object, or extent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but in regard of their ſubject, or the matter promiſed, 1. Some are more generally propounded; as when the Lord promiſeth to <hi>hear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 58.9. Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>to anſwer, to ſave, to be plenteous in mercy, to be nigh, to be rich over them that call upon them: or that they that ask, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> and the like. Theſe are promiſes of good ſucceſs to prayer, without deſcending to any expreſs or determinate way or manner of their ſpeeding, or the return to be made. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes run more particularly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely upon the doing or giving of the thing prayed for: As that, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14.13 14.15.7</note> 
                     <hi>that will I do:</hi> And that, <hi>If ye ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it:</hi> So in divers particular promiſes; as unto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for wiſdom,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.5.</note> the promiſe is, <hi>It ſhall be given to him that asks it:</hi> and for a Brother that hath ſinned,<note place="margin">2 Joh. 5.16</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death.</hi> For the holy Spirit:<note place="margin">Luk. 11.13</note> 
                     <hi>Your heavenly Father ſhall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> It may be obſerved by the way that theſe promiſes that run particularly upon the doing or giving of the thing, are (at leaſt for the moſt part) promiſes of ſpiritual things: and this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of promiſes to prayer, that ſome are for hearing and return, others for a grant or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the thing, may be of uſe to us in the ſequel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It follows that we come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ſence and manner wherein the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169943:71"/> promiſes (both the irreſpective, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) are made, and to be taken by us, in bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toming our prayers upon them; and ſo we come home to the point of the groundedneſs of prayers upon the promiſes.</p>
                  <p>For this, we muſt heedfully obſerve in every promiſe two things: 1. The thing promiſed; as this or that benefit, or an audience or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of prayer. 2. The condition, circumſpection, or qualification, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: for God never promiſeth, that, be men what ever they will or can be, they ſhall have ſuch bleſſings; neither is his Word out, that whoſoever puts up a prayer, or howſoever it is put up, or whatſoever it, be for, he will hear and do it: but there are certain bounds, limits, or proviſo's, inſerted in his promiſes, by which he confineth them, and unto which we muſt keep in our dependance upon them. Theſe limits or proviſo's (as far as I obſerve) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to ſix heads: 1. Concerning the perſon praying. 2. The manner of the prayer. 3. The matter. 4. The order. 5. The circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, means, and the like. 6. The end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the perſon praying, the promiſe is to the prayer of <hi>a righteous man</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Jam. 5.16 1 Pet. 3.12 Pro. 10.24 15.29</note>, <hi>of a godly man</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 32.6.</note>, <hi>of him that feareth God</hi>

                     <note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 15.7</note>, <hi>and one that keepeth the Commandments of God</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 3.22</note>: Theſe are to be the qualifications of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon praying; and he that is not ſuch a one, is an unpromiſed perſon; if he cometh to God
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169943:72"/> in prayer, he comes without the promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the manner of prayer: The promiſe is to the prayer, 1. That is made in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 16.23 24</note>. 2. In the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note n="b" place="margin">Ro. 8.27</note>. 3. In Faith<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 21.22</note>. 4. In Truth<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 145 18</note> and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. 5. In Fervency<note n="e" place="margin">Jam. 5.16</note>. 6. In Love and Charity<note n="f" place="margin">Mark 11 25</note>. 7. With Humility<note n="g" place="margin">Pſ. 10.17</note>. 8. With con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 18 1, 7</note>. Theſe muſt be the accompliſhments of the prayer, beſides thoſe foregoing of the perſon. And let it here be noted, that the perſon may be furniſhed with thoſe conditions above required in him, and yet his prayer may be without theſe: The man may be a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and a godly man, one that feareth God, humble, obedient; and, that which inferreth all theſe, one in Chriſt: and yet his prayers may be, not in the mediation of Chriſt, or not in the help of the Spirit, or not in Faith, Truth, &amp;c. For, that the prayer may be ſo qualified, there is required an actual recourſe to Chriſt, operation of the Spirit, exerciſe of Faith, Sincerity, Zeal, Love, Humility, and Conſtancy. Now that which the perſon hath in the root, principle, or habit, may lie unacted, may not reach, or be put forth into the action of prayer: but the promiſe requireth them both; to wit, both that the Suppliant and the Prayer be qualified, each with thoſe their proper characters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Concerning the matter: There is for this a double limitation; 1. The promiſe is to what we pray for,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.14.</note> ſo <hi>it be according to the Will of God:</hi> This <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his Will, here
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169943:72"/> I conceive to intend, not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his Will of Purpoſe, or Decree, for that is to us in moſt things unrevealed; but his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his Will of warrant, or his revealed Will to be done by us; his Will of precept, or approbation, made known to us in his Word, for a Rule to us. To pray for anything according to his Will then, is to pray for that which is lawful, and allowed us by his Word to be prayed for. All the promiſes of God are arguments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to the obedience of his Will; and therefore certainly none of them may be underſtood to hold out or promiſe any benefit to irregular deſires. 2. The promiſe is to what is prayed for that is a good thing: <hi>Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven ſhall give good things to them that ask him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7.11.</note> Good here is to be taken, not <hi>in genere moris,</hi> for good, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated in Gods Word, or good according to the precept; for that was the meaning of the laſt reſtriction before: but good <hi>in genere utilis,</hi> that is, profitable or beneficial: and that not only ſo good ſimply, or in it ſelf, but good complexedly, or in its circumſtances; that is, good for the party <hi>pro hic, &amp; nunc,</hi> as the caſe is now with him; and good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, that is, better then the want of it, or another thing put in the room of it, or into the ballances with it. Indeed the ſubject of all Gods promiſes is ſome good thing, as is the object of all rational deſires; but good here is underſtood to be a note of reſtriction, to confine the matter of other indefinite and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169943:73"/> irreſpective promiſes of good things to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, circumſtantiated, and comparative goodneſs, as to the exerciſe and expectation of prayer. Some things indeed are abſolutely good, that is, invariably, both in their own nature, or kind, and in whatſoever individual circumſtances of perſon, time, or the like, you can clothe them; and this is becauſe they are abſolutely and univerſally neceſſary: ſo are all ſpiritual bleſſings in reſpect of eſſence, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore to them this limitation reacheth not: but other things are of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſs, and neceſſarineſs to us; ſuch are temporal things, and ſome ſpiritual gifts, in regard of us, or of this or that degree of them. Theſe are all good in themſelves, but any of them may be inexpedient, if not hurtful, to us, in this or that caſe conſidered. This deficiency or mutability of goodneſs (in point of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs) of ſome things, which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſome promiſes, and may be made the matter of our prayers, is the reaſon that this proviſo is put in: they are promiſed, they may be taken into our prayers ſo far as they are good for us. Many of the benefits ſtored up in the Treaſury of Scripture-promiſes, are like the multitude of excellent Simples, or Drugs, layd up in an Apothecaries ſhop, whereof all are good in their kind and place, but they are of ſeveral, and ſome of contrary natures; ſo that ſome of them are good for one mans uſe, ſome for another; ſome fit for one ſeaſon and need, ſome for another; very few are for all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169943:73"/> turns and times: and therefore men do not come for, and buy them promiſcuouſly, but with the skilful Phyſicians advice and <hi>recipe.</hi> In like ſort are the benefits of the promiſes, good in the abſtract and kind of them, but not all ſo catholically or unalterably good; and therefore not commended, or tendered to us without reſpect and caution: and this is the ſtamp they muſt have to make them currant to our prayers and confidence, if they be good for us.

                  <p n="6">6. The laſt Requiſite to Prayers conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Promiſe, is, that it be to the right end. The general end, which every prayer muſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at, is the honor of God, and our Souls good. And, beſides, there are intermediate and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ends of prayer, differing according to the ſubject. As if our prayer be for the good of a Brother, or a Nation, or a Church, our heart muſt be upright to that end. <hi>David</hi> enjoyning us to <hi>pray for the peace of Jeruſalem;</hi> adds this promiſe, <hi>they ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi> The words may intend the proſperity or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of prayer: and then the promiſe is thus limited; they ſhall proſper in their prayer, or ſpeed in it, that love <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and loving pray for her; or, pray for her out of love to her,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169943:77"/> that is, for her good. But the honor of God, and our ſpiritual good in him, is the univerſal end of all our prayers; and this end may be layd down in that promiſe, <hi>Ye ſhall find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart:</hi> And in that,<note place="margin">Jer. 29.13. 2 Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thoſe promiſes aſſure us to find him; but upon this proviſo, that we ſeek him to that end. From this end do thoſe prayers decline, of which the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Jam. 4.3.</note>

                  <p>And thus I have endeavored to open the ſence wherein the Promiſes are made, and to be taken by us in our making uſe of them in prayer. We muſt learn to take along their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169943:78"/> meaning and force, circumſcribed with theſe qualifications touching the perſon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the manner, matter, order, and end of peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning; and the Circumſtances (where the promiſe is not particular in them) of time, means, and manner of performance. True it is, theſe points are not all expreſt, or literally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in every promiſe; yet they being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where expreſt, are always to be underſtood, and to be ſupylyed out of their parallel places. As for example; there is a promiſe, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.13</note> This may ſeem very large and lax: But the very next Verſe ſupplyeth it with one main limitation; <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</hi> Faith muſt be an ingredient in their invocation, who may have a title to that promiſe: and other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo's muſt be borrowed from other places for the due bounding of it in every qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of what hath been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the grounding of prayer, I will now ſum up in theſe few Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The promiſes made unto prayer (as of hearing or giving upon it) are not extenſible beyond the Rule or Precept for prayer; that is, we are not by vertue of the promiſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or expect to be heard and anſwered in any requeſt, but ſuch as we have a warrant for in the Word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A prayer may be ſaid to be grounded on the promiſes of God two manner of ways.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169943:78"/> 1. With reſpect to the matter only (in the kind and nature of it) as when the thing prayed for is in the promiſe. 2. With reſpect both to the matter and to the conditions of the promiſe, and to every one of them, either preſcribing ſuch and ſuch qualifications to be in the perſon and in the prayer, and in this both in regard of manner, matter, order, and end of the ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or reſerving a latitute in the time, means, and manner of performance. That a prayer then be compleatly grounded on the promiſes, it is required, not only that the thing prayed for be the ſubject of a promiſe, but that there be (in reality) all theſe conditions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas we have above diſtinguiſhed of the promiſes unto prayer, that ſome are in more general terms, as to hear, anſwer, help upon prayer put up; others are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as of doing, giving this or that thing in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial: We are to note thereupon a threefold Rule. 1. That promiſes unto prayer are more determinate touching ſpiritual things, ſimply neceſſary for us, then touching other things: in theſe the promiſe uſually is in general of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and anſwer; in thoſe it is often of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giving the particular thing. 2. General promiſes of hearing are to be interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of ways wherein God may be ſaid to hear or anſwer (of which by and by,) and muſt not be reſtrained to one way of hearing or anſwering. 3. Promiſes muſt be differenced according to their ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſome being of invariably good, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169943:79"/> neceſſary things; others are of things of a mutable or indifferent nature; theſe muſt be taken conditionally, if they be good in the caſe wherein they are ſought: and, becauſe we our ſelves know not when or how far they may be good or neceſſary for us, or others, in whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half we ask them; that our prayer may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the promiſe, we are particular caſes concerning ſuch things, to pray with ſubmiſſion and reverence to the infinite wiſdom, and moſt gracious diſpoſition of God, deſiring the thing only if it ſhall be good in his eyes, and leaving the determination of that condition to him: ſo that ſuch promiſes and petitions muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into that general modification. It is the Note of the <hi>Divines</hi> (in the late Engliſh Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the Bible) upon that prayer of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> unto God, <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 33.18, 19.</note> and the Lords anſwer to it, <hi>I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee: Moſes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>makes his demand of Gods glory, and he anſwereth him by the mention of his goodneſs; whereby he promiſeth, that ſo much as is good and profitable for him to know, he will reveal unto him.</hi> And ſurely if we have Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhewed and communicated to us, though we have not our wiſh, or our eye ſatisfied, or the particular given us which our prayer may be for; yet it is as fully conform to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſo ſufficient, and beſt for us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I will add one Propoſition here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers for others, and the promiſes made unto them. I conceive the conditions required
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169943:79"/> of him that prayeth, as faith in Chriſt, and the reſt (eſpecially what ever is neceſſary to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being acceptable unto God) muſt alſo be in the perſon prayed for, elſe no ground of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to ſpeed for him. The Rule of Precept indeed binds to pray for others however; and he that prayeth as he ought, hath aſſurance to be heard ſome way other; and ſometimes God doth hear his ſervants for others not ſo qualified: but aſſurance that his prayer ſhall be heard to the good of the other perſon, he hath none that I know of, unleſs the other be ſo qualified: For inſtance, The promiſe in the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle is, <hi>The prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 5.15</note> 
                     <hi>and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him:</hi> This muſt be, as I apprehend, underſtood as well of the ſick's Faith (who is to call for the Elders of the Church to pray over him) as of the Elders Faith: Forgiveneſs of ſins is not promis'd nor given (that I know) but upon the Faith of the perſon forgiven. We cannot think to have others receive corporal or ſpiritual good by our prayers upon eaſier terms then we our ſelves can; or that we may be prevailed for by others praying, repenting, believing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our own. I obſerve, when the man ſick of the Palſie was brought to Chriſt by his friends, <hi>When Jeſus ſaw their Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 2.3. Luk. 5.18</note> 
                     <hi>he ſaid to the ſick of the Palſie, Son, thy ſins be forgiven thee. Their Faith;</hi> that is, the ſick mans and his friends, for he was born of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169943:80"/> four; and they that brought him to Chriſt uncovered the roof of his houſe, and let him down through the Tiling before Chriſt: all their Faiths, both the parties and theirs that thus moved for him, concurred. Again, our Saviour directing his ſeventy Diſciples at his emiſſion of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>into whatſoever houſe they enter, to ſay, Peace be to this houſe,</hi> he tells them withall, <hi>If the ſon of peace be there, your peace ſhall reſt upon it; if not, it ſhall turn to you again:</hi> their prayer could be only effectual to true Believers.<note place="margin">Pſa. 35.13</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> praying and faſting for his wicked and perſecuting Enemies, his prayer returned into his own boſom.<note place="margin">Exo. 32.27 33. 4 Joſh. 7.6, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> at one time, and <hi>Joſuah</hi> with the Elders at another, praying, turned away Gods wrath from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but it was when <hi>Iſrael</hi> repented, humbled themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the offence: Otherwiſe (I think) the caſe is plain, particular men (though. they muſt pray) yet they cannot confidently look to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Gods Judgments from a Nation, unleſs the Nation repent and amend<note n="*" place="margin">See Jer. 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that when we would obtain the deliverance, or proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a people, the ready way is to pray for, and endevor their repentance. True it is, we are not able to diſcern infallibly theſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in another perſon, or people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot attain an infallible certainty of prevailing for them; but it ſufficeth to the making of our prayer, that we have a precept to pray for them; that we have any hope or poſſibility of the thing; that the

Our prayers for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proceeding upon theſe terms, it will behove us to look more at our duty, then any infallible certainty of the particular iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to them; to be more preſſing in our deſires, then peremptory in our reſolves; and, if we reſolve on any things, it may be this, That if we ſeek God aright, we ſhall not ſeek him in vain.

The diverſity of the grounds, or impulſives, whereupon he walketh in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat diverſity of ways. The unfolding of theſe two will (I hope) ſerve much for the clearing of this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of the diverſity of the ways, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior of God towards the prayers of men. The ſuppoſition, that the carriage or way of God towards mens prayers is various, I need not labor to prove; it will be confeſt. The matter to be ſtood on is, What that Variety is? It hath two parts in the general very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to apprehenſion, to wit, 1. His inclining, appearing to prayer: 2. His declining, hiding from prayer. But beſides, there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity under each of theſe; God doth many ways appear to, and many ways hide from prayers: his appearing is of divers ſorts, his hiding is of ſeveral kinds. I will begin with the former, Gods appearing to prayer; and therein conſider the ſeveral ways of his in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clining or appearing to prayers, or to perſons
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169943:81"/> praying. Theſe are to be comprehended under two heads: The firſt is in hearing, or receiving the prayer: The ſecond is in making a return, or giving anſwer to prayer. Both theſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> exemplifies to us together: <hi>I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</hi> And again, <hi>This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 34.4 6</note> 
                     <hi>and ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi> There is firſt hearing, and ſecondly delivering: firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prayer, or cry; then delivering, or ſaving the perſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God inclines or appears to prayer when he receives or hears it, when he gives it admiſſion or audience; this is at the putting up or preſenting of the prayer: <hi>Whiles they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> It's ſaid unto <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 65.24</note>

                     <hi>and to caſt thy ſelf before thy God, thy words were heard.</hi> This act of reception of prayer, though in ſome ſort it be more largely extended (as will after be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is (prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Word of God ſetteth forth the Lords entertainment, and acceptance of prayers, with great variety of expreſſions, and thoſe very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory and ſweet; as if it ſtudyed to point it out as an act of very great worth, and a thing very notable and affective: when it is thus,

                  <p>The ſecond is Gods anſwer, or making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to prayer: The Lord appears to prayers
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169943:82"/> by anſwering them; and this is the appearance whereof we are more ſenſible: this is that we find in the Prophet; <hi>Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhalt cry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 58.9</note> 
                     <hi>and he ſhall ſay, Here am I. David</hi> tells us, <hi>That when in his diſtreſs he called upon the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 18 6</note> 
                     <hi>and cryed unto his God, he heard his voyce out of his Temple, and his cry came before him, even unto his ears:</hi> that was the firſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of prayer, of which before: It then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>He bowed the Heavens alſo, and came down, and darkneſs was under his feet; and he rode upon a Cherub, and did fly, yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind: the Lord alſo thundered in the Heavens, &amp;c. yea he ſent out his arrows, &amp;c.</hi> that's the latter effect, the return and anſwer: the Lord did viſibly and mercifully appear for his help and reſcue, as is there figuratively and largely ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>There were indeed times when God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn anſwers to his people audibly, or ſenſibly; by appearances, or voyces; as he did by viſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> and others; by voyce or viſible token to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the High-Prieſt in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Mercy-ſeat; and by Dreams, by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> by Prophets from time to time, to his people <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſometimes by Angels to ſome of them. But theſe returns, ſome of them were peculiar to thoſe times, others were then extraordinary, and now much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; and neither then were, much leſs now are, to be looked for. There is another
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169943:83"/> way of return which is more common and conſtant, and that is by his workings: of this <hi>David</hi> makes relation, <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined to me, and heard my cry: He brought me up alſo to an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and ſet my feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock, and eſtabliſh'd my goings.</hi> This his raiſing out of the pit, and ſeating upon a firm ſtanding, is the active anſwer of God to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> prayer. Now this return of prayer is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways made; and the ſeveral ſorts of it muſt be well noted. I ſhall diſtinguiſh them thus: There is a threefold anſwer of prayer; or return is made thereto three ways: 1. By way of obſignation: 2. By way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: 3. By way of commutation. Theſe three ways God anſwereth the prayers of his ſervants when they are faithfully put up, and grounded as before was ſhewed; that is, ſome one (at leaſt) of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe three ways.</p>
                  <p>The firſt way is obſignatory: this is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by way of teſtimony, or aſſurance of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and audi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ce of the prayer that hath been offered up to God; or by way of Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or pledg of future accompliſhment. God is pleaſed many times, before he perform the requeſt of his ſervants, to give them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or upon their ſeeking to him, a pledg that they are heard, and ſhall have an iſſue of their deſires: This he doth uſually, when the performance is to be at ſome diſtance of time; and the Petitioner muſt bear ſome delay for it; then he vouchſafes often to give (as it were) a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169943:83"/> Bill of aſſurance under his hand in the <hi>interim</hi> for it. But what is it that God doth give in pledg? why, ſomething ſtill that is both valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſuitable: <hi>Some fire (as it were) comes down from Heaven upon the Altar, and conſumes their ſacrifice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 20.3</note> in teſtimony of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. This obſignatory anſwer may be by divers effects or ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By an inward taſte or teſtification from God, of his good-will and love to the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 33.26</note> 
                     <hi>and he ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> had prayed, and wreſtled all night, and had got the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and bleſſing yielded him, <hi>He called the name of the place Peniel</hi> (that is, the face of God,)<note place="margin">Gen. 32.30</note> 
                     <hi>for I have ſeen</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>God face to face.</hi> The requeſt that he had been conflicting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, was, to be delivered from the hand of <hi>Eſau</hi> his Brother; he had it granted, and in aſſurance he ſhould find it fulfilled the day following in the reconciled face and embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Brother, he hath immediately the ſight of Gods face, and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhewed him; and this made him go on with boldneſs of heart, though with a halting thigh, from <hi>Peniel</hi> to meet his Brother. The Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he had faſted, and made his ſupplications unto God,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.13 10.11 8.26 10, 1, 14 7.28 8.27</note> had ſeveral times an Angel appearing to him, and telling him, <hi>He was greatly beloved,</hi> to wit, of God; the viſions ſhewed him were <hi>for many days, and the time appointed was long:</hi> and ſome of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169943:84"/> them were ſad, and unpleaſing unto him: But in the <hi>interim,</hi> and for a cordial, he had this meſſage ſent him from God, that he was a man in high favor with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By a removal of that ſorrow, dejection, fear, or anxiety of ſpirit, that before might poſſeſs and fill him that prayed. <hi>Hannah,</hi> having poured forth her prayer and tears, and uttered her vow before the Lord in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and received that good preſage from <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt of her Petition;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1 18</note> it's ſaid, <hi>She went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more ſad:</hi> ſhe thenceforth had a light heart; her fretting, her unchearful look, her meatleſs meals were now layd aſide. There is a promiſe to them that ſeek God, <hi>That he will make them joyful in his houſe of prayer:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 56.7 30.19</note> as he will beſtow thoſe bleſſings upon them which they crave, ſo he will for earneſt make them joyful before they go out of his houſe. And in the ſame Prophet; <hi>Thou ſhalt weep no more; he will be very gracious unto thee at the voyce of thy cry. David</hi> praying, and being in a very heavy taking, <hi>having his Soul caſt down within him, and deep calling unto deep at the noiſe of Gods water-ſpouts, and all his waves and his billows going over him:</hi> that is, he being, as it were, overwhelmed in a Sea of ſorrows; evils flowing upon him like waves one at the heels of another; had this reviving giving him:<note place="margin">Pſa. 42.4, 7, 9</note> 
                     <hi>Yet the Lord will command his loving-kindneſs in the day time, and in the night his ſong ſhall be with me, and my prayer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169943:84"/> unto the God of my life.</hi> The Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his loving kindneſs; that is, he will diſpatch it forth to him inſtantly, as a winged Meſſenger, and Harbinger of a good iſſue of his prayers and afflicting griefs: And whil'ſt he is praying, the ſong of God ſhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and recreate him; his own prayer, and Gods ſong, ſhall joyn company together, and both at once aſſociate him. The Souls under the Altar, <hi>that cry, how long O Lord, &amp;c.</hi> they are put to ſtay ſome time for their vindication;<note place="margin">Apoc. 6.11 Eccleſ. 9.7, 8</note> but, in the mean ſpace, it's ſaid, <hi>White robes were given unto every one of them:</hi> Thoſe white robes might betoken a chearful habit of ſpirit, a good meaſure of alacrity put into them during their ſufferings, yet to be prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in aſſurance of their anſwer and releaſe in due time to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By a continuation of the Spirit of prayer, or an exerciſe of it: When the hands are ſtill ſupported in their lifting up to God, or raiſed and ſtretched out higher towards him; when the motions, vigor, and vehemency of prayer are renewed or redoubled in the hearts of Gods ſervants, it is a token from God that it ſhall not be in vain, but to ſome purpoſe and effect that they call upon him.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 12.3, 4</note> When <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſtrength in wreſtling with the Angel was ſo great, and did hold out until day break, and he was ſo ſet that he would not let the Angel go until he had bleſſed him; this was a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his power and prevalency with God; and that he ſhould prevail with men alſo, with

                     <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem the ſpirit of grace and of ſupplications,</hi> is put in the Prophet as a fore-running preſage and introduction to many great mercies to them. The Apoſtle brings in this as a clear earneſt to Believers, of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from ſins and ſufferings, and of receiving the glory and redemption of the body expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and groaned after; That <hi>the Spirit help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our infirmities, and maketh interceſſion for us (in prayer) with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26</note> As it is a ſpecial favor, and a good ſign to a people, that God gives to his Prophets <hi>the opening of the mouth</hi> (in declaring his Word,)<note place="margin">Eze. 29.21</note> ſo it is alſo that he beſtows upon them a mouth opened wide, and a voyce loud, and lifted up in prayer: <hi>Open thy mouth wide</hi> (ſaith God to his <hi>Iſrael) and I will fill it.</hi>

By an erected confidence; and it may be a clear foreſight and evidence, that the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is diſpatched in Heaven, and ſhall aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be accompliſhed in time on Earth: This pledg God doth ſometimes vouchſafe his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones upon their ſeeking of him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he work to the effecting of their prayers: as it is in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble,</hi>

                  <p>This may be ſufficient for the illuſtration of the firſt way of the Lords anſwering prayer, to wit, by way of Obſignation, or Aſſurance, wherein we have noted four inſtances or acts.</p>
                  <p>I come to the ſecond kind of anſwer, which is by way of performance; this is when the thing entreated for in prayer is accompliſhed: This is the moſt ſenſible and moſt noted way of prayers return from Heaven to the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner: <hi>David</hi> deſcribes it in that his benedicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pſalm:<note place="margin">Pſa. 20.1, 4 21.2</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, &amp;c. Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counſel:</hi> and in the next Pſalm to that, <hi>Thou haſt given him his hearts deſire, and haſt not withholden the requeſt of his lips.</hi> It will not be unneceſſary to obſerve the ſeveral methods of this anſwer of performance: 1. Sometimes it is inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or diſpatched all at once; it is finiſhed in one compleat act; as when <hi>Samuel</hi> cryed unto the Lord for <hi>Iſrael</hi> at what time the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins</hi> Army ſtood ready to give the on-ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord heard</hi> (or in the Margin) <hi>anſwered him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.9 10</note> 
                     <hi>and, as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philiſtins drew neer to battel againſt Iſrael; but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philiſtins, and diſcomfitted them, and they were ſmitten before Iſrael.</hi> 2. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſucceſſive, or effected by degrees;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169943:86"/> when the ſervants of the Lord in their ſtraits and needs call upon him, he often helps them <hi>gradatim,</hi> or by ſucceſſive ſteps. Two ſteps more frequently he makes in this work: 1. He ſends ſtrength and ſupport under and during the affliction, or want of the benefit deſired. 2. And then after he gives them deliverance from it, he looſens the bands of their diſtreſs, and they eſcape out of it: both theſe we have diſtinctly noted in divers Scriptures, as in that of the Pſalm, <hi>He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him,</hi> (and mark the degree of the anſwer which follows,) <hi>I will be with him in trouble,</hi> (there's the one,) <hi>I will deliver him, and honor him,</hi> (there's the other.)

There is <hi>a day when God makes up his Jewels,</hi> (or, as <hi>Druſius</hi> interprets) <hi>a day when he makes Judgment, or proceeds in Judgment,) and in that day, they, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts, ſhall be my Jewels, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him:</hi> that's the firſt day, and firſt ſtep of ſuccor. The Lord will own them for his in the evil day, he will take care of them as of his choyceſt and preciouſeſt goods; and he will moderate their ſhare of troubles, and ſupport them therein: ſo that (as it is in the next words) there ſhall be a palpable difference put and diſcerned betwixt them, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſufferings. 2. There is another day cometh after, <hi>a day that ſhall burn as an oven;</hi> and in this latter day is that other ſtep of the help of thoſe fearers and ſeekers of God; that is, their deliverance and full ſatisfaction: <hi>For, in that day, the proud, yea and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble; and the day that cometh, ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch: But unto you that fear my Name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his wings, — and ye ſhall tread down the wicked; for they ſhall be aſhes under the ſoles of your feet, in the day that I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169943:87"/> ſhall do this, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will further note, that the latter of theſe two degrees of Gods return to prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> Deliverance out of trouble, or fruition of the thing asked, may have its ſeveral degrees alſo: As, 1. When God raiſeth up the means and ſecondary cauſes which he will uſe, and ſets himſelf to work by them: 2. When he doth carry on and conſummate deliverance with them. This order he purſued in bringing <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon the hearing of their cries and groans; he firſt appears to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Midian,</hi> and gives him a Call, Commiſſion and Inſtructions to go into <hi>Egypt</hi> and fetch them out: <hi>I have heard</hi> (ſaith he to them out of the burning Buſh) <hi>their groaning,</hi>

                     <hi>I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the Earth, And the Earth ſhall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169943:88"/> ſhall hear Jezreel; and I will ſow her unto me in the Earth, and I will have mercy on her, &amp;c.</hi> Such a <hi>ſeries</hi> of cauſes and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Providence of God doth often go through in delivering his people. This is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken figuratively in the Prophet; not as if the Heavens, and the reſt of the inferior Creatures here, had a voyce, or did pray: and we muſt not underſtand it as ſpoken of the order of Gods receiving, but of his performing prayers: In order of receiving prayer, God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only hears <hi>Jezreel,</hi> his people; but in order of anſwer and execution, he firſt hears, or anſwers the <hi>Heavens,</hi> that is, puts <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> into them; and then, by them, into the <hi>Earth,</hi> and by the <hi>Earth</hi> into its <hi>fruits,</hi> and ſo comes home to <hi>Jezreel:</hi> and then alſo <hi>Jezreel</hi> muſt be <hi>ſown</hi> in the Earth, that is, muſt be caſt into the ground, and lie under the clods of affliction, and be in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as dead for a time, and then ſpring up, and be reſtored. <hi>The ſmoke of incenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 8.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand,</hi> by it and them were procured the ſeven following Trumpets. Now theſe Trumpets, the iſſue and execution of thoſe prayers, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſucceſſively one after another, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh thoſe prayers by ſo many degrees; and the term of their ſucceſſion and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ere all be finiſhed, is ſuppoſed to be for many years, yea divers ages.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſecond way of prayers receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169943:88"/> its anſwer, and the ſeveral ſteps of it.</p>
                  <p>The third, and laſt, is that of Commutation. The Lord doth ſometimes hear and anſwer the prayer, when he doth not give the very thing prayed for: There is an anſwer by way of exchange, to wit, when God gives in lieu of that which is asked another thing, which is as good, or better for the party. God grants Petitions, either formally, or by way of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency: he returns unto him that prayeth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which he prayeth in kind, or the ſame in weight and value, though not in kind. Our Saviour teaching us how to pray, withall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms how we may expect to be heard: <hi>Pray to thy Father which is in ſecret,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly:</hi> He doth not ſay, thy Father ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely do the very thing requeſted, but he ſhall reward thee; he ſhall give thee a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and retribution of thy prayer, one way or other: he ſhall reward thee openly, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, though not identically: He ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thy Petitions, if not by way of punctual execution, yet by way of compenſation of them; if not by way of literal conceſſion, yet by way of counterballancing: And when it is thus, the prayer is truly and ſufficiently anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; although it be ſomwhat varyed, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it is denyed; God in ſo doing doth not fruſtrate our requeſts, but rectifie our choyce. <hi>Samuel</hi> being at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to anoint one of <hi>Jeſſes</hi> ſons to be King,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.6</note> when they were come before him, he look'd upon <hi>Eliab</hi> as the man;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169943:89"/> he look'd upon him for his countenance, and the height of his ſtature; but God put him by, and the reſt that followd, until <hi>David,</hi> the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the eight, came, &amp; him he appointed to be anointed: So it is with us, when we pray, we ſometimes fix our eyes, and faſten our affections and wiſhes upon one particular, when God ſees another fitter, and puts that in the room; and when it is thus, the countenance, face, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual form of our Petition (as in <hi>Samuels</hi> caſe) is altered, but not the benefit. We have one of the ſame ſtock and kind, though not the ſame thing<note n="*" place="margin">As old <hi>Iacob</hi> layd not his hands of bleſſing, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> would have guided them, but layd the right hand upon the younger ſon, whom <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did ſet at his left; So often doth God take off his hand of bleſſing from the thing we pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and lays and diſcovers it in another more for our good. And as God, giving <hi>Iſaac</hi> the power and priviledg to bleſs a ſon, though <hi>Iſaac</hi> he intended it for <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet God unbeknown to him, tranſmitted it to <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet ſo, as the bleſſing was not loſt: Thus it is in our prayers for bleſſings both upon our ſelves and others. Mr <hi>Goodwins Return of Prayers,</hi> cap. 9. ſ. 4</note>.</p>
                  <p>We may note divers ways of Gods making this Commutation; particularly three: 1. In regard of Perſon: 2. In regard of Matter: 3. In regard of Means.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of Perſon: <hi>David faſts, and prays,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 25.13</note> 
                     <hi>and humbles his Soul for his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and his prayer is returned into his own boſom:</hi> He intended it for them, it is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own benefit.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12 15</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> again beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God for his firſt child by <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> when the Lord had ſtruck it with ſickneſs, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169943:89"/> that child dyes; but the Lord gives him in ſtead thereof another child, a ſon, a <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> one whom the Lord loved, and choſe to ſit on his Throne after him. So it pleaſeth God in mercy to transfer the prayers of his ſervants from one to another, from others to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: If <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14</note> and <hi>Job</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Land, when it hath treſpaſſed griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, neither ſon nor daughter in it, yet they themſelves ſhall be delivered.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.5, 6</note> If the <hi>Diſciples</hi> benediction of <hi>peace</hi> reſt not upon the houſe into which they enter, <hi>it ſhall turn to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> The Lord heard <hi>Joſiah</hi> praying for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 22 19</note> but not to the deliverance of them from Judgments, but to his own taking away from the evils to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The change may be in regard of Matter: As, 1. When carnal things are begged, God ſometimes makes his return in ſpiritual things; when earthly and temporal bleſſings are asked, he turns them in heavenly and eternal mercies. The Diſciples after Chriſts Reſurrection asked him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 1.6, 7</note> they meant it of the civil Freedom, Property, and Dominion of their Nation in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Chriſt our Saviour refuſes to anſwer them poſitively to that, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power:</hi> but in ſtead of their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that demand, he gives them a promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and of aſſiſtance, enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſucceſs in their function: <hi>But ye
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169943:90"/> ſhall receive power, after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermoſt part of the Earth.</hi> The two ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> come to Chriſt, deſiring him to grant them <hi>to ſit, the one at his right hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 10.35</note> 
                     <hi>the other on his left in his glory:</hi> Our Saviour declines the grant of that requeſt, but in the place of it he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth them <hi>that they ſhould drink of his cup, and be baptized with his Baptiſm.</hi> Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the grace, ability, and honor ſo to do, was far more deſirable and acceptable in a true eſtimate, then all that earthly glory of Chriſt, which thoſe brethren fancyed and affected, and ſuppoſed was to come preſently. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God had ſentenced him never to go into the promiſed Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> beſought God with great importunacy for the reverſion of that ſentence, and for a paſſage over into that Land; the Lord would not hear him, but ſaid, <hi>Let it ſuffice thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 3.23</note> 
                     <hi>ſpeak no more to me of this matter:</hi> But what was it wherewith he would have him ſufficed? it was this, He ſhould go up to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and thence take a view of all the quarters of that Land, and ſo dye where he was. Now by this means <hi>Moſes</hi> was conſidered well enough in his Petition, though it were not given him to his wiſh: for he was eaſed of his heavy and often bemoaned charge over that people, and removed from the tireſom Wars of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then beginning, into reſt and peace in a better <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169943:90"/> the heavenly. A worthy Divine obſerves, <hi>That oftentimes the very denyal</hi> (of the particular) <hi>breaks a mans heart, and brings him neerer to God, and puts him upon ſearching into his ways and eſtate,</hi>

                     <hi>and in his prayers to ſee what ſhould be amiſs therein, which alone is a great mercy, and better then the thing; ſeeing by the loſs of that one thing he learns to pray bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo to obtain a hundred better things afterward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In requeſts for ſpirituals, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one benefit is asked, and another of that nature is ſubſtituted for it, which is equivalent to it. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> moleſted with <hi>the thorn in his fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7</note> 
                     <hi>the meſſenger of Satan buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting him,</hi> went to God in prayer, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him thrice over, that it might depart from him:</hi> In ſtead of that removal begged, the anſwer is, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Here the Apoſtle obtained the ſpiritual help he asked, in ſubſtance the ſame, but not in the very ſame way, or ſpecial kind; he had given him, not the removal of the temptation, but the ſupplement of divine grace to countermand it; not the taking off of the Enemy, or the dart that ſtruck him, but the armor to fence, and wave it off the Souls life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sometimes in deprecations, and prayers for deliverance from trouble,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.29</note> in ſtead thereof it is given to the ſervants of God <hi>to ſuffer;</hi> that is, they are enabled to ſuffer with confidence, patience, joy, ſtedfaſtneſs, profit,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169943:91"/> in wiſdom and holineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> with confidence. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.55 &amp;c.</note> ſaith, <hi>I called upon thy Name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon; thou haſt heard my voyce:</hi> But how? <hi>Thou dreweſt neer in the day that I called upon thee; thou ſaidſt, Fear not:</hi> He, or they, would have been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up out of their dungeon, but the Lord heard them another way; he diſpelled their fears of drowning, or pining, in it: he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto them a ſupply of confidence; he raiſed them out of the dungeon of dread and terrors. In like manner our bleſſed Saviour in his Paſſion and Agony, <hi>He offered up prayers and ſupplications,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5.7</note> 
                     <hi>with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard, in that he feared.</hi> The ſubject of his prayers, as appears in the Goſpel, was, <hi>That he might be ſaved from that hour; That that cup, if it were poſſible, might paſs from him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exauditis precibus liberatus a metu, <hi>Beza (i. e.)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatus fuit ut om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem pavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem mortis depoſuerit. <hi>Idem.</hi>
                     </note> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was heard, in that he feared;</hi> or, as <hi>Beza</hi> readeth, <hi>His prayers being heard, he was delivered out of fear:</hi> when the bitter cup of his agony, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and death drew nigh, his Soul was troubled; he began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy; <hi>His Soul was exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful unto death.</hi> Under theſe horrors, he conditionally, if it might ſo be, and with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Fathers will, deſired to avoyd thoſe ſufferings; <hi>He was heard, in that he feared;</hi> not by his Fathers removing then, or preventing of the ſufferings, but by a vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169943:91"/> of thoſe terrors, by a greatneſs of ſtrength and might beſtowed on him, to wade through and tread that dreadful winepreſs. 2. With Patience: <hi>Job</hi> was jealous of his ſons, that in their circular feaſting <hi>they might ſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 1.5.20</note> 
                     <hi>and curſe God in their hearts;</hi> for the expiation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>he every day ſent and ſanctified them, and in the morning offered burnt-offerings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their number:</hi> Notwithſtanding this his care and devotion, the ruine of his children would not be prevented; yet, although he could not ſcape it, he had a plentiful meaſure of patience, and acquieſcence under the hand of God in it miniſtred unto him. When he receives the tydings of it, and all his other loſſes together, <hi>He fell down upon the ground, and worſhipped; he bleſſed the Name of the Lord, and he refrained all charging of God fooliſhly.</hi> 3. With Joy; <hi>David</hi> would fain have beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God his childs life,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12</note> and recovery from ſickneſs; he could not do that, but dye it muſt; but upon its death, when his ſervants judged, by his taking on at its ſickneſs, that upon the ſudden hearing of his death he would have miſchieved himſelf<note n="*" place="margin">How wil he then hurt himſelf? <hi>marg.</hi>
                     </note>, he contrarily could bear it with an admirable temper, not only with moderation of grief, but with alacrity, and the exerciſe of piety. 4. With Stedfaſtneſs: The Apoſtle willeth us, <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 4.6, 7</note> 
                     <hi>with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> And the conſequent upon this, which he promiſeth for certain, is, <hi>And
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169943:92"/> the peace of God, which paſſed all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus: q. d.</hi> If ye do not obtain your deſires in particular at all, or not inſtantly, yet the peace of God,<note place="margin">Praeſidio erit, <hi>Bez.</hi>

With Profit, both in wiſdom and holineſs: The Lord aſſures his praying people this gracious iſſue of their cries; <hi>Though he give them the bread of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 19.20 &amp;c.</note>

The like is promiſed to <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> prayers:<note place="margin">Jer. 33.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Call unto me, and I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty</hi> (or hidden) <hi>things,

Thus God heareth prayers in way of exchange of the matter prayed for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways; and in ſo doing he moſtly gives better things then thoſe he waveth, and ſo makes his Petitioners not only ſpeeders by his anſwer, but gainers by his exchange.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Commutation may be in regard of Means: When we have a mercy aſſured us by promiſe, we may and muſt uſe means for the atchieving of it; and in the uſe of the means we are to pray (with ſubmiſſion) for a bleſſing upon it, unto the attaining of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by it. Now when we have thus prayed, God may ſee cauſe to vary the means; that is, lay aſide that which we ſelect, employ, and bring before him in our prayers, and take up other; and by this means, of his own choyce and exchange accompliſheth his promiſe, and our expectation and prayer, in regard of the mercy aymed at. This Commutation, as it is ordinary, ſo it may well paſs with us, ſo far as Gods agency and anſwer to prayer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; in as much as the means inſerted
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169943:93"/> in our prayer in order to its end: and though we be tyed to the uſe of that means which is lawful and preſent, yet neither is God himſelf, nor the end to be attained, ſo tyed. If it pleaſe God to put by the means which he hath given us to uſe, and our hearts and deſires are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon, and to intermit other, and effect the end promiſed and prayed for thereby, we have our expectation and our prayer alſo in equivalency. I would not be miſunderſtood; I know there is now adays a queſtion raiſed, Whether, or how far a means moſt righteouſly employed by God, but ſinful as unto its own interpoſition and acting, may be owned, and concurred with: But there is no queſtion to be made (as I think) but that the event produced by ſuch a means (if it were lawfully deſired and prayed for, though expected and ſought by other means) may be acknowledged, and acquieſced in as from God, and in return of prayer. Though we may not uſe, or joyn iſſue with unlawful agents and actions, yet we may receive and enjoy a benefit by the providence of God accompliſhed by them. When the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was looſed out of priſon by <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> the Captain of the guard to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he might well take it as the fulfilling of Gods promiſe, and anſwer to his prayer, whether that Captain or his maſter had any right over the place he was then in,<note place="margin">Jer. 40.1 c. 15. 11, 15</note> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> could own them as Proprietors thereof or no. Believers may well embrace Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, as the accompliſhment of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169943:93"/> and the deſire of all Nations for their Salvation, although the warrantableneſs of thoſe mens actions, and power to do it that did it, and confederation with them, might be denyed with abhorrence: But enough of this caution by and by. Prayer is, and hath been anſwered by an exchange of the means. <hi>Abraham,</hi> having the great Promiſes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God made unto him, and to his ſeed, he prayed for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> then born of <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.17</note> 
                     <hi>That</hi> (as it ſeems) <hi>he might be the child, and heir of the promiſe:</hi> The Lord (though he heard him in part for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> too) would not yield to that, but would have a ſon yet unborn, and of <hi>Sarah,</hi> to be the ſeed of promiſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> would fain have been the man to have gone and conducted <hi>Iſrael</hi> over <hi>Jordan</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and prayed for it;<note place="margin">Deut. 1.37 38</note> but the Lord otherwiſe and better diſpoſed of him, and appointed <hi>Joſhua</hi> his ſervant to that office. <hi>David</hi> had fully purpoſed,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 28 2, &amp;c.</note> and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his endevors to build a houſe for the Name of God; the Lord accepts of the intent of his heart, but will not let it go on, but transfers the honor of that work from him to his ſon <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have thus the third way of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> by Commutation and Equivalency: The ſum and iſſue whereof is, although God do alter from the letter of the prayer, either in reſpect of the perſon, matter, or means eyed by the Petitioner, yet he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a proportion and equality to, if he do
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169943:94"/> not tranſcend the thing prayed for, in making his return: and in altering thus, He <hi>(who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think)</hi> conſidereth,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.20</note> and procureth the good of them that pray,<note place="margin">Exardit ſaepe ad profectum non ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>Aqui. in Joh 9.</hi> Permittas ipſis expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quid conveniat nobis rebuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſit utile noſtris. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal. Saty. 10. Joh. 12.27, 28 Mat. 26.33</hi>
                     </note> and he fulfilleth the ſubſtance, drift, and ſcope of their prayers, to wit, the advancement of his own glory, the Churches good, and their own comfort and profit: and if theſe be any ways brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by their prayers, they muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg themſelves anſwered. Chriſt our Saviour, when in his extreameſt diſtreſſes he prayeth to his Father, <hi>to ſave him from that hour, and to let that cup paſs from him,</hi> he doth immediatly and with the ſame breath pray, <hi>Father, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy Name: and nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt, and thy Will be done.</hi> By theſe latter Petitions he doth not croſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf in the former, but reduplicates, illuſtrates, and gives his words a due ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and latitude: and as his practice, ſo was his doctrine of prayer, and it deſerves to be obſerved: when he would teach his Diſciples to pray by a copy, or pattern, he delivers them a platform, wherein are comprehended all things requeſtable, not in ſpecial terms, but reductively under ſhort and general heads; and in the very mold or ſtructure of that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er informs us thus much, That as in framing our prayers we are to reduce and ſquare all our Petitions to thoſe heads, though we vary in particulars, as occaſion requires; ſo we muſt expect God to do in the anſwer: and we muſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169943:94"/> obſerve, and reckon our anſwer, rather by thoſe heads, then our own occaſional and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated requeſtings.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral ways whereby God appeareth unto his peoples prayers, have been thus far ſet forth: It now follows on the other hand to ſpeak of his declining or hiding from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the various ways thereof: Theſe being anſwerable to thoſe of his appearing to prayer, there will be the leſs need of much labor to diſcover or dilate upon them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This hiding may be in reſpect of audience or reception of prayer, when the Lord refuſeth to receive, or rejecteth and repulſeth the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; when he gives it no entrance to him, nor countenance: He ſaith to the people of <hi>Judah, When ye ſpread forth your hands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 1, 15 Jer. 14.12 Lam. 3.56 Pſa. 27.8, 9.66.10.</note> 
                     <hi>I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers, I will not hear: when they faſt, I will not hear their cry: and when they offer burnt-offerings, and an oblation, I will not accept them.</hi> This is that which the Church deprecates, or deſires God, that it may not be to her; <hi>Hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</hi> So doth <hi>David, Thy face Lord will I ſeek: Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy ſervant away in anger:</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he giveth God thanks that it was not ſo with him; <hi>Bleſſed be God which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a hiding from prayer in regard of anſwer or return, when the effect or fruit
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169943:95"/> of prayer is not received from God; when it is, as ſometimes it was with the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 18 29</note> 
                     <hi>They cryed aloud, but there was neither voyce, nor any to anſwer, nor any that regarded:</hi> So the Lord ſaith, it ſhall be with obſtinate ſinners; <hi>Then they ſhall call upon me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1.28 Pſa. 18.41</note> 
                     <hi>but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me:</hi> And ſo it was with <hi>Davids</hi> adverſaries, <hi>They cryed, but there was none to ſave them, even unto the Lord, but he anſwered them not.</hi> And this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of prayer, may be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Obſignation, when there is no evidence to the Soul of audience: As, 1. When there is no ſign of favor: <hi>Bleſſed be God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that hath not turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my prayer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 66.21</note> 
                     <hi>nor his mercy from me:</hi> It was a token to him that his prayer was not turned away from God, becauſe Gods mercy was not turned away from him. Of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite it's ſaid,<note place="margin">Job 27.9</note> 
                     <hi>Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? will he delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Almighty?</hi> It is an argument God hears not him, becauſe he finds no delight in God. 2. When there is no animating, no drop of comfort to the ſpirit: <hi>In the day of my trouble</hi> (the Pſalmiſt complains) <hi>I ſought the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 77.2</note> 
                     <hi>my Soul refuſed to be comforted: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God, and was troubled; I complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my ſpirit was overwhelmed.</hi> 3. When there is a declining or drooping in the ſpirit of prayer:<note place="margin">Job 27.10</note> 
                     <hi>Will the Hypocrite always call upon God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job?</hi> It was ſo in the Prophets time,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169943:95"/> even with Gods people:<note place="margin">Iſai. 64.7</note> 
                     <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee; for thou haſt hid thy face from us, and haſt conſumed us becauſe of our iniquities.</hi> And it was ſo in part with <hi>David</hi> ſometimes: <hi>I am weary of my crying, my throat is dryed;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 69.3</note> 
                     <hi>mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</hi> 4. When there is no diſcovery of Gods intent or reſolution concerning our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: This was the Churches caſe, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it; <hi>We ſee not our ſigns, there is no more any Prophet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 74.9</note> 
                     <hi>neither is there any among us that knoweth how long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of performance: ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Judah</hi> were fruſtrate; <hi>Behold the voyce of the cry of the daughter of my people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them that dwell in a far Country: Is not the Lord in Zion? is not her King in her? The Harveſt is paſt, the Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved: Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Phyſician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of exchange, or any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in lieu of the thing: So they ſay in the Prophet, <hi>It is in vain to ſerve God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3.14</note> 
                     <hi>and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoaſts?</hi> No advantage, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn comes by prayer and faſting any way.</p>
                  <p>God may be ſaid to hide himſelf from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all theſe ways. But I muſt further add a diſtinction or two, that I may not leave this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169943:96"/> matter too indifferent and promiſcuous.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We may obſerve that Gods hiding from prayer is, 1. Sometimes real, and ſo in deed. 2. Sometimes only in appearance, or in the apprehenſion of men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſometimes real; as in all thoſe places of Scripture where the Lord threatens or owns it ſo to be, and often gives the reaſon from mens provocation why it is ſo: As for inſtance in that of the Prophet, <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortened that it cannot ſave,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 59.1, 2</note> 
                     <hi>neither is his ear heavy that it cannot ſave, but your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have ſeparated between you and your God; and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> Here the hiding and diſtance from prayer is real on Gods part.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is at other times but in appearance only and in humane apprehenſion: God hears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yea and anſwers, when he ſeemeth not ſo to do; or when men do think and believe that he doth not: and, in this caſe, the defect is in mans ſenſe and perception. Now God is accounted not to hear his ſervants prayers, when indeed he doth: 1. Either in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others: Thus <hi>David</hi> relateth often the concluſion which his Enemies, or the ſpectators of his condition made of him, that he was reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and diſowned of God; as in the rebellion of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> whiles <hi>David</hi> was in his flight and prayer, there were divers that ſtood looking on, and cenſuring him as an abject from God: <hi>There be many which ſay of my Soul, there is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169943:96"/> no help for him in God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 3.2 42, 3. &amp;c. 71.11.</note> And in his Exile through <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecution, when he was pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and craving after Gods preſence in his houſe, his adverſaries upbraided him, ſaying, <hi>Where is now thy God?</hi> and this filled him with tears continually, and pierced him like a ſword. And in another <hi>Pſalm,</hi> penned (as is thought) during <hi>Abſaloms</hi> inſurrection, his Enemies ſpeak again him, and conſult, ſaying, <hi>God hath forſaken him, perſecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him:</hi> but this is not ſo ſtrange, that others in their malignant judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo apprehend it. 2. Or in the ſenſe or conceit of them that pray: Even the people of God themſelves when they pray, and God hears them, they may deem themſelves unheard, unanſwered; they may take themſelves to be denyed of God, when he graciouſly receives their prayer: Sometimes God harkens to, and anſwereth them, but they hear not him, they are deaf to their anſwer. We are ordinarily better acquainted with our own prayers then with Gods performances, and are more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in asking, then in receiving or diſcerning our ſucceſs. As ſometimes Gods promiſes or predictions are fulfilled, yea and we are actors in the fulfilling of them, but we ſee it not, (thus was it with the <hi>Jews</hi> in relation to Chriſts death,<note place="margin">Acts 3.17, 18.13.27 Joh. 12.14,</note> yea it was ſo with the Diſciples themſelves in ſome circumſtances concerning Chriſt,) ſo are our prayers grounded on the promiſes. How often do we find <hi>David</hi> in the ſame <hi>Pſalm</hi> one while complaining, <hi>Lord,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169943:97"/> how long,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 6.3 10.1 13.1 22.1 43.2</note> 
                     <hi>how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long wilt thou hide me for ever? Why ſtandeſt thou afar off? why hideſt thou thy face in times of trouble? why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the day time, and thou heareſt not, &amp;c. Why doſt thou caſt me off? why go I mourning becauſe of the oppreſſion of the Enemy?</hi> and uſing the like expoſtulations; and by and by, ere he breaketh off his ſpeech, he correcteth himſelf; he ſeeth, and is ſatisfied that the Lord hath heard him;<note place="margin">Pſa. 6.8 10.17 13.6 22.24 43.5</note> and declareth, <hi>The Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping, the Lord hath heard my ſupplication, the Lord hath delt bountifully with me: Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble; he hath not despiſed nor abhorred the affliction of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cryed unto him, he heard: Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? &amp;c. I ſhall yet praiſe him who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> Here was no want of hearing, but want of perceiving the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and ſucceſs of prayer. We are ſo dull that God muſt not only give us our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but give us eyes to diſcern them; he muſt not only hear our prayers, but give us ears to hear his anſwer to them. We are ſo inſenſible and inconſiderate, as not to own, yea and to charge God with want of advertency, when all is well, and to our deſires, if we had eyes and hearts to ſee and underſtand. <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:169943:97"/> therefore makes this ingenuous recollection and acknowledgment of his imperfection (once for all) as touching this caſe; <hi>For I ſaid in my haſte, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheleſs thou heardeſt the voyce of my ſupplications when I cryed unto thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 31.22</note> 
                     <hi>I ſaid in my haſte;</hi> here he clears and wipes off the many dark and erroneous conceits and ſpeeches he had in his troubled moods uſed of God, in relation to his prayer; and ſtates the point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right betwixt God and him, confeſſing Gods audience even at the inſtant when he had cryed and complained for want of audience, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his own blind precipitancy in apprehending and uttering the contrary.</p>
                  <p>There are two occaſions whereupon the people of God are apt thus to miſconceive the iſſue of their prayers; 1. The continuance or increaſe of their afflictions upon them, or the delay of their expectations and deſires: They judg of their audience and acceptance with God by the preſent courſe of their providence; and will needs gather, his ear is not open to them, his face is not towards them, if his hand do not inſtantly help them, if his arm be not made bare for them, and in their ſight, if his candle do not ſhine upon their head: Thus did <hi>Job,</hi> and his ſpeech of it is notable; <hi>If I had called, and he had anſwered me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 9.16, 17</note> 
                     <hi>yet would I not believe that he had harkened to my voyce;</hi> and why? <hi>For he breaketh me with a tempeſt, and multiplyeth my words without cauſe,</hi> (or as <hi>Tremel. without remedy:</hi> others interpret
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169943:98"/> 
                     <hi>without rendering a cauſe.) Job</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Gods hearing him, becauſe he found it not in his preſent outward eſtate, but felt what he thought ſpoke the contrary, to wit, a ſtorm and tempeſt of adverſities, renewed ſtrokes and inciſions of the lancing knife of Gods ſpiritual Chyrurgery. Mr <hi>Caryls</hi> Notes upon this place are; <hi>God may be doing us good when the ſigns he gives us may ſpeak evil; he hears and anſwers us praying to him, when we think to hear him thundering terribly againſt us. Afflictions continued is no evidence that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not heard, yet uſually it is very inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to an afflicted perſon that his prayer is heard: prayer may be heard and anſwered when greateſt afflictions are upon us; even while we are praying, the Lord may be thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, he may be breaking us when we are beſeeching him.</hi> So he. The Church in the <hi>Lamentations</hi> ſaith unto God,<note place="margin">Lam. 3.42, 43</note> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy ſelf with a cloud, that our prayers ſhould not paſs through:</hi> and ſhe apprehended ſo upon this ground, <hi>Thou haſt covered with anger, and perſecuted us; thou haſt ſlain, thou haſt not pityed:</hi> Becauſe God hath cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with anger againſt their ſins, therefore they collected he had covered himſelf with a cloud againſt their prayers: Becauſe he had perſecuted them, therefore their prayers pierced not to him. 2. Again, ſometimes it is becauſe of the amplitude or greatneſs of the ſucceſs of their prayers, and the extraordinarineſs of Gods workings for them: <hi>When the Lord
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169943:98"/> turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 126.1, 3</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord hath done great things for us.</hi> Their deliverance was ſo great that they were ſurprized and amazed with it, it overcame their conceit and belief. When <hi>Peter</hi> was ready to be brought out to his death,<note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> and the Church had prayed inſtantly and without intermiſſion for him, the Lord by an Angel brought him out of priſon, and he preſently came to the houſe where the Saints were aſſembled together, and praying for him; but when he knocked at the door, and the Damſel knowing his voyce, ran in and told them he was there delivered up to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it was incredible to them; they ſaid of the maid, <hi>Thou art mad;</hi> they ſaid of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>It is his Angel:</hi> when their eyes ſaw him, <hi>They were aſtoniſhed.</hi> Great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns cannot eaſily or quickly find entrance and credit in our minds: they are like the great draught of fiſhes which the Diſciples caught upon the command of our Saviour to caſt forth the net; when they had taken it, the net brake, and their ſhip began to ſink with it: ſo are our hearts on ſuch an occaſion; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well at firſt receive, they cannot land with, or hold with the larger incomes of prayer.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt diſtinction neceſſary to be obſerved; there is alſo another to be added.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt again diſtinguiſh, when the Lord doth indeed and really hide himſelf from prayer; This may be, 1. Either by way
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169943:99"/> of abſolute and flat denyal of the prayer: 2. Or only in way of delay, or deferring for a time. This difference ſhould be well heeded: every real hiding of God from prayer is not negative, is not a rejection and caſting of it back as denyed; and every denyal is not final and reſolute. God doth often defer what he intends to grant, nay what he hath already granted in Heaven; yea, ſometimes he hath in a ſort expreſly denyed the Petition, when it hath indeed been but in effect a delaying, and the repulſe hath been in order to a conceſſion. When <hi>the woman of Canaan</hi> cryed ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently upon our Savior in behalf of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vexed with a Devil,<note place="margin">Mat. 15:22</note> and he gave her a treble put off, the end proved it was no peremptory denyal, but only a delay, for the tryal and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of her great faith.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> under their ſore diſtreſs by the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and others, cryed unto the Lord with confeſſion of their ſin in forſaking him and ſerving <hi>Baalim;</hi> and the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, that for thoſe their ſins relapſed into, after many former deliverances in the like caſe, <hi>he would now deliver them no more: Let them go and cry unto the gods whom they had choſen,</hi>

                     <hi>and let them deliver them in the time of their tribulation:</hi> This was not a ſimple abjection, or a concluding denyal, but a ſharp and minatory rebuke to work them to a more ſerious humiliation and reformation, and to make way (ſo) for a better anſwer to their prayer, which afterwards they had. It hath
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169943:99"/> been alway ordinary with God to ſuſpend the anſwer of thoſe prayers which he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hear and aſſent to, and to put a diſtance of time betwixt the grant and the execution of them, and that for many good reaſons, which may come to be diſcovered in their place.

                  <p>I have thus endevored to ſhew the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ways of God towards the prayers of men, both in appearing to, and hiding from them.

Firſt, for the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing unto prayer, the difference of grounds may be thus taken: He doth appear to prayer, 1. In Anger: 2. In Favor.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                     </note> not for need; and diffidently, not in faith; and God gave them accordingly, out of anger, and with the plague: they were the laſt meat that many of them ever ate; they brought them to their graves, the graves of them that luſted. Doubtleſs Monarchy was and is in it ſelf a good Government, and was promiſed long before as a bleſſing to that people, and (as it appeared by the ſequel) was intended them ſhortly as a mercy, and it is as a mercy

                  <p>And we may note, God gives ſometimes evil and unlawful requeſts in wrath, or for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to others beſides the askers.

                  <p n="2">2. God appeareth to prayer in mercy and favor, and this may be more ways then one: It may be, 1. Out of his general goodneſs, and common pity: God hath a propenſion to ſhew mercy, a diſpoſition to extend favor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, as they are his creatures, as they are in want and miſery,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Aqui.</hi> 22. qu. 83 Art. 16 Job 34.28 Exo 22.23 Gen. 21.17</note> as they may put forth and expreſs their natural deſires before him: <hi>He heareth the cry of the afflicted,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu: I will ſurely hear their cry,</hi> ſaith he himſelf of the widow and fatherleſs child: God heard the voyce of the lad <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Thus it comes to paſs, that many times very wicked men have their deſires and prayers in temporals granted them. The Lord took notice of <hi>Ahabs</hi> humbling himſelf upon <hi>Elijahs</hi> reproof and denunciations; and becauſe of it he ſaid,<note place="margin">1 King. 21 29</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God appeareth to prayer out of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor which is ſpecial and more peculiar; he heareth the faithful ſeekers of him, his own children, from a neerer impulſive, out of a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169943:102"/> dearer reſpect and conſideration which he beareth towards their perſons, out of a federal and fatherly love; and he embraceth their prayers not only out of a general, but out of a ſpecial benevolence; nor meerly with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, but with complacency and acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their prayers are as ſweet as incenſe to him. To the dwellers in <hi>Zion</hi> the Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">Iſai. 30.19</note> 
                     <hi>He will be very gracious unto thee at the voyce of thy cry:</hi> Theſe are the different grounds of Gods hearing prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For Gods hiding from prayer, he doth it alſo upon the like different grounds: 1. It is ſome, yea moſt times out of wrath; and that is either, 1. Judicial, or a wrath of loathing and hatred; a full, pure, unallayed anger; ſuch he bears to carnal wicked men, and to their prayers,<note place="margin">Zech. 7.12 13</note> as it is in the Prophet, <hi>Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of Hoaſts: therefore it came to paſs, that as he cryed, and they would not hear, ſo they cryed, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi> 2. Or Paternal, and Conjugal; the wrath of a Father or Husband, a wrath tempered with, and in time overcome, and ſwallowed up of love, intimate and peculiar love; a wrath joyned to bowels of mercy; ſuch is that in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſai. 57.17 18</note> 
                     <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth, &amp;c. I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him; I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts to him, and to his mourners.</hi> Such a wrath as is again expreſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169943:102"/> by the Lord in the ſame Prophet, <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 59.8</note> 
                     <hi>but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer.</hi> Mark well the great difference of this wrath from that which is againſt others: it is the preſent wrath of a provoked Husband againſt an offending Wife, by which ſhe is widowed, caſt off, and ſo barren and deſolate (in her prayers) for a time, (for ſo are the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) <hi>The Lord hath called thee as a woman forſaken, and grieved in ſpirit, and a wife of youth, when thou waſt refuſed, ſaith thy God.</hi> Again, it is <hi>a little wrath,</hi> and <hi>but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and a <hi>ſmall moment:</hi> The ſum is, it is a moderated anger, mixed with a dear relation and band of affection to them; and it is a ſhort, and quickly cooled, and forgotten wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This hiding from prayer is ſometimes out of mercy; yea, it may be in ſpecial favor, and the favor in withholding may be greater then it would have been to have granted the thing prayed for. It may ſeem otherwiſe, but the very truth is, God doth ſometimes deny his peoples prayers in indulgence and mercy to them: they not ſeldom are ſet upon that which would be hurtful for them, and ask the things which would be very bad for them to have: in this caſe the want of their deſires is better then the grant; and God conſulteth their good, ſheweth them favor in withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wiſhes from them. <hi>Rachel</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169943:103"/> bent to have children, <hi>Give me chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>or elſe I dye:</hi> Well, at length ſhe had her longing, but what came of it? ſhe dyed of child-bearing; her ſecond child was her <hi>Benoni,</hi> the ſon of her ſorrow; ſo named by her ſelf: he was her bane and death. As God giveth ſometimes in anger, ſo he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth and denyeth ſometimes in good-will and love. As the natural father will give none but good gifts to his children; he will not give his ſon a ſtone, a Serpent, a Scorpion, for Bread, for a Fiſh, for an Egg: So neither will our heavenly Father. If the natural father will not exchange good pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions into bad gifts, much more will our heavenly Father ſuſpend bad Petitions, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change them into good gifts<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>I ſhall now only gather up all into a few Corollaries, or ſummary Propoſitions, fitted by way of Anſwer to the Query. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, <hi>How, or in what ſenſe God may be ſaid to hide himſelf from his peoples Prayers grounded upon his Promiſes, and ſeem by his Providences to anſwer the Prayers which are contrary thereunto?</hi> I anſwer,</p>

The matter of their prayers may be indeed the matter of the promiſes, but the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169943:104"/> quality of their prayers is never correſpondent to the conditions of the Promiſes. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace are offered, propounded, and conditionally made to all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally called, all that paſs under the paſtoral Rod of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">The Covenant is actually made with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only, but it is offered to all.

When and ſo far as God doth hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his faithful peoples prayers, it is not only righteous in him, and conſiſtent with his promiſes (either their prayers not holding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with his promiſes, and ſo he is free; or his proceedings exactly correſponding thereunto (though it be not diſcerned) and ſo he is faithful,) but it is in mercy to them, either in withholding from them their deſires, when bad for them; or in reſerving them, either till they be reduced to their rule, if they be irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that they may have them in a promiſſory way, or till they be ripened to that exerciſe and growth of grace, wherein they may be moſt acceptable and profitable to them.

The breath of our Prayers muſt fill the Sails, but the divine diſpoſal muſt tend the Card and Compaſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In judging of Gods appearing to, or hiding from their prayers, the faithful ſeekers of God are not to reſt in their own ſenſe, or eye-ſight, nor in the preſent face of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or ways: theſe may yield them for a time no anſwer, no teſtimony of audience: they are like the <hi>viſion</hi> in <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeaking, but having a peculiar time to ſpeak, <hi>At the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lye:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 2.3</note> yea, theſe may yield them occaſion of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, or doubt, when indeed the Lord hath a reſpect to their prayers, is mindful of a return, and an anſwer may be in drawing or diſpatching out to them: And further, they are to look over all the ways of hearing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Teſtification, Performance, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; leſt their anſwer may be with them, and they not aware of it, not find it out<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Calv.</hi> Inſtit. l. 3 c. 20 S. 52</note>.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As divine providence may at preſent ſtand at a diſtance from, or proceed oppoſitely to prayer, even whileſt prayer may be heard and anſwered, or in anſwering: ſo it may run
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169943:109"/> parallel, or go along with it; it may act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and anſwerably to prayer; it may produce what prayer hath asked, and yet nevertheleſs the prayer may be unanſwered: all this may be, and not in anſwer to prayer. Therefore, as God may be apprehended to hide himſelf from his peoples prayers, when indeed he doth not, but ſets open the door of mercy and his hearing ear to them, and ſets awork his hand of providence in the beſt manner for them: ſo he may be conceived to anſwer the prayers that are contrary to them, when indeed it is nothing ſo. As God ſometimes hears the prayer when he doth not give the thing, ſo he ſometimes gives the thing when he doth not hear the prayer. This ſeeming Paradox I will endevor to make clear by inſtances and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The <hi>Danites</hi> meſſengers, whom they ſent to ſpy out the Land of <hi>Laiſh</hi> for them, as they went, turned into the houſe of <hi>Micha,</hi> and in the Idolatrous way of his Religion (that is,<note place="margin">Judg. 18.</note> by the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> and carved Image, and molten Image, which he had made; and by the young <hi>Levite</hi> which he had conſecrated, and kept as his Prieſt for that Idolatry,) <hi>enquired of God</hi> (as they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it) concerning the ſucceſs of their expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the ſaid Prieſt returned them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Go in peace, before the Lord is your way wherein ye go:</hi> and according to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it ſucceeded with them; they diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and immediately conducted the ſix hundred <hi>Danites</hi> (who for their better ſpeed robbed

                     <hi>Micah,</hi> and took along with them thoſe his good preſaging Idols and Prieſt) unto a large and good Land (which was that they ſought after and lacked) and they moſt eaſily and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly conquered the Inhabitants, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Land, and enjoyed it long, though <hi>they there ſet up Micahs graven Image and ſuperſtitious Prieſthood, all the time the houſe of God was in Shiloh.</hi> Here Providence ſpeeds, and ſuits with the ends and enterprizes of thoſe devotions, which certainly could not be but very diſpleaſing unto God, and therefore could not be followed with any ſuch ſucceſs for the prayers ſake. In like manner <hi>Saul</hi> (when as <hi>Samuel</hi> came not to <hi>Gilgal</hi> within his time) he took in hand to offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings (either in his own perſon, or by another) contrary to the Commandment of God,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13 9, 12</note> that (as he pleaded to <hi>Samuel) his Soldiers might not deſert him, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins might not ſet upon him, before he had made ſupplication unto the Lord.</hi> Well, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this his ſacrilegious, or otherwiſe preſumptuous Error, in thus ſeeking to God, contrary to his Will and way preſcribed, yet he goes out preſently to his War againſt the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and though he had a very ſmall Army, but ſix hundred men, and neither ſword nor ſpear found in the hand of any of them, yet he proſpered, and got the victory: The Text ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaved Iſrael that day,</hi>

Male-contents (ſaith one) are commonly great Queſtioniſts. But the matter is to enquire wiſely, to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, ſober, impartial, and profitable inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: this we are not very apt unto; and if at all we be diſpoſed, and ſeek to know it, we find it no eaſie work to make the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: it proves a difficult enterprize, and hard to effect, not becauſe we do not ſeek, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are deſtitute of means to find it out, but becauſe we go wrong to work; we look not the right way, or we look not with good eyes, or we look not to the right end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We look not the right way: we are apt to look for the fault or fail in God, or to charge it upon him at all-adventures, when the root of the matter is in our ſelves. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Haggai,</hi> when the Houſe of God lay waſte, and the peoples labors were all impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, and their wealth and ſtore unbleſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; when they ſhould have conſidered their own ways, wherein they might have found a plain reaſon why it was ſo, they turn their eyes up to Gods ways and deſignments; and in them, in ſtead of meeting with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">Hag. 1.2</note> they make one: <hi>They ſay, the time is not come, the time that the Lords Houſe ſhould be

We ſee our ordinary labors about natural means, and for our bodily proviſions, our ſowing and reaping and day-laboring, yea and the efficacy of natural cauſes, as of the Heavens ſending down dew, and the Earth ſending forth fruits, and the fruits affording their ſuſtenance; theſe all decay, and diſappoint us of their benefit: how then ſhall we think to ſpeed in that harder and higher work of Temple-building? Thus their want of duty to God in the forward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of his Houſe and Worſhip (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſucceſleſſneſs their own affairs was the effect) they will needs father on Gods Decree, and falſly ſurmiſe an immaturity of his time.</p>
                  <p>In like manner did the ſame people in the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi>'s time; they miſſed of the expected promiſe of divine ſervice, to wit, the bleſſing of God upon their ground and tillage; and what reaſon do they find for it? who is in the fault in their judgment? why, they lay it upon God:<note place="margin">Mal. 3.9, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Their words are ſtout againſt him; they ſay, it is in vain to ſerve God, and profitleſs that they kept his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that they have walked mournful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi> The truth was, the cauſes were groſly and palpably extant in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169943:113"/> themſelves; and that in the very point of Gods ſervice, they deſpiſed and profaned his Name, they polluted and villified his offerings, they grew weary and ſnuffed at his worſhip, and they robbed him in Tythes and Offerings; yet they caſt the blame of the fruitleſſneſs of their Religion upon him: nay, a ſpice and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this error, a proneneſs to look upon God and his ways ſomewhat awry, even the ſervants of God are ſubject unto; as was <hi>Job,</hi> whom <hi>Elihu</hi> is offended at, <hi>becauſe he juſtified himſelf rather then God:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed we are prone many ways to direct our enquiry amiſs, in regard of the place or ſubject, and to ſeek moſt for the fail where it is not: in this we are like the <hi>Lapwing,</hi> who makes the greateſt fluttering and cry when ſhe is furtheſt from her neſt: we are readier to look towards God then man to find it; and in looking towards him, we are more ready to look into his providences then into his Word, and into his Decrees and Purpoſes then into either: and when we do look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, we are apter to look into others for it then into our ſelves; and in looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, rather into them that are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and diſtant from us, then near home, or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169943:113"/> into the men of our confederacy: As, when <hi>Ahab</hi> would father the trouble of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, We look not with good eyes, not with a cleared ſight, but ſome or other miſt or diſtemper blears our eyes.

                  <p>Such is the propenſion of mans nature, when an unhappy event muſt be ſomewhere charged, to caſt it upon other mens backs to bear, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their own; and, of all others, ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt on thoſe upon whom they have any ſpleen or malice placed: and this readineſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg and impeach others, may often be the cauſe of mens miſcarrying in the diſcovery of the true reaſon of the ſad occurrences or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences they meet with.</p>
                  <p>As I have given divers inſtances of that propenſeneſs, and of this effect of it, let it be without offence if I paſs not over one inſtance more, it being ſo plain, preſent, and pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us.

                     </gap>rs impetuous ſegregations. It is far from my intent, either to be an Umpire of theſe diſcordant cenſures, or to involve all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, called by any of theſe names, within the compaſs of ſuch partiality, and prejudice in their thoughts of this matter: nay, here I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake not to be a reprehender of any, but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169943:118"/> only an obſerver of all, and in all, how uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly conſtruction follows oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We look not for a right end: and this may be it that prevents us in this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: In enquiring after the reaſon of ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, our aym (it may be) is not to find out the cauſe, that cauſe which it behoves us to look after and know; but (poſſibly) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: as ſomtimes it is to ſatisfie our own curioſity, out of which we buſie our thoughts and ſtudies in prying after ſecrets; either the reſerved and hidden counſels, motives, and purpoſes of God; or the covered Cabinets of other mens cloſe contrivances and proceedings. Sometimes it is that we may find fault, and pick a quarrel with God or man: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is meerly to feed and vent our own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſcontent, to enlarge our plaints, to furniſh with matter our repining and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts, and that (if we can meet with any thing in the likeneſs of a cauſe) we may have the more to complain of. Our asking after a reaſon often is like enquiry which <hi>Jehonan,</hi> and the other Captains, and people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> ſlaughter of <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> made of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and by him of <hi>God,</hi> concerning what way the <hi>Lord</hi> would have them to go: They enquired with an intent, not to follow the appointment of God, but their own minds; and rather that the Prophet might bring an anſwer to fit the deſign that was already in their hearts, then that they ſhould bring their hearts and deſigns to the Prophets anſwer. So
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169943:118"/> we in this caſe, our wiſhing and ſeeking to know the cauſe, is, not to diſcover what in that kind is requiſite and uſeful for us to know, but to faſten on ſomething that may ſuit with our over-curious, quarrelſom, or querulous natures. Our end is rather to plead with God then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit our ſelves, to carp at others then to correct our ſelves; to exclaim at the dealings of men with us, then to trace out and amend our own doings. And hence it is, that with <hi>Siſera's</hi> mother, we do often both ask the queſtion and give the anſwer: Our own ſurmiſing heart is the Oracle we go to, and we will know no more then likes our ſelves, and fits the indirect end for which we enquire. There are theſe impediments, or cauſes of difficulty, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of miſſing, in our ſearch after the reaſon of croſs providences in general, and of this (the Lords hiding from his peoples prayers) in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And beſides theſe, which ariſe from our ſelves, from the imperfections that lie upon our own judgments, I might obſerve others; but having inſiſted ſo far on theſe, and becauſe theſe (in as much as they are from our ſelves) are the impediments we have moſt need to take notice of, it ſhall ſuffice but to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one or two more: <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lo theſe are parts of his ways, but how little a portion is heard of him?</hi> There are parts (or, as ſome interpret it) <hi>ends,</hi> that is, <hi>extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or <hi>outmoſt parts</hi> of Gods ways which are diſcovered; but how little a portion or parcel are they, in compariſon of the whole? <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.12</note>

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith again, <hi>He doth great things and unſearchable, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous things without number:</hi> Here are four things ſpoken of Gods works, which advance them above our reach; <hi>He doth great things, unſearchable things, marvelous things, and things without number.</hi> We have no line that can meaſure or fathom them, no Arithmetick that can caſt them up. Unſearchable (ſaith a learned Expoſitor) may be conſidered two ways: 1. Which cannot be ſearched; ſo are many of his works, myſterious in regard of the manner, cauſes, and ends of their doing. 2. Which ought not to be ſearched into: they are to be adored by believing, not to be pryed into by ſearching: <hi>Zophar</hi> ſaith of God, <hi>Canſt

                     <hi>Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</hi> We may be ſearching find God, but we cannot find him out; that is, we cannot find the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of God; or, as ſome read the end of the former clauſe, <hi>the laſt thing of God:</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find him out to perfection, that is, we cannot attain to the perfect diſcovery of what God doth. Mr <hi>Caryl</hi> cites a learned Author tranſlating that word <hi>Perfection</hi> by <hi>the parts about the heart,</hi> or <hi>the cloſeſt lodges of the heart;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Canſt not find out the inmoſt receſſes or ſecrets of Gods heart?

                     <hi>which we cannot comprehend; touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:</hi> We muſt never think to meaſure or bottom his works: we may not look to go about or reach the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent or whole circumference of them from ſide to ſide, or to ſound the depth of them from top to bottom; if we do, we ſhall come immeaſurably ſhort, and perhaps be ſwallowed up.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved, that in every humane art there is a myſtery, and there are ſome rules and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therein which are not vulgarly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but known only to the Arts-maſters: if it be ſo in mans workmanſhip, how much more in Gods?

                  <p>The example is that of <hi>Job</hi> and his three Friends: They (in <hi>Jobs</hi> heavy taking) enter into, and maintain on both ſides, and carry ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far on, a perplexed debate about Gods providence towards righteous and wicked men, and the differences and ends thereof; from which neither part came off clear and innocent, much leſs ſatisfied or ſatisfying to their Reader: in the end therefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf interpoſeth to decide the controverſie (when <hi>Elihu</hi> had aſſayed, and could not,<note place="margin">Job 38.1</note>) and <hi>ſpeaking out of the whirlwind,</hi> blameth them both: <hi>Job</hi> he faulteth ſomewhat, to wit, of preſumption and raſhneſs; but his three Friends more, to wit, of unſoundneſs and untruth in their ſeveral diſcourſes of his ways: and he ſo deals with them both, as that he drives them to recant their Errors, and return into the bounds of piety and charity. Let this example inſtruct us:<note place="margin">Job 40.3.42.1</note> let us not forget the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſelf-abhorring, and retractation,</hi> which <hi>Job</hi> was brought unto; nor the <hi>kindling of Gods wrath againſt Eliphaz and his two friends,</hi> and what attonement, by ſacrifice,<note place="margin">Cap. 42.7</note> and the interceſſion of <hi>Iob,</hi> they were put to.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of ſetting up a skreen, or drawing a ſhadow betwixt us, and the thing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169943:123"/> we enquire after; I mean, of an allowance of our ſelves, or a purpoſed continuance in any known ſin againſt God; to bolſter up our ſelves, or to diſpenſe with our ſelves in any known way of wickedneſs, is wilfully to put a vail before our own eyes, and induſtriouſly to prevent our ſelves of finding out that which we pretendingly ſeek to know. And (by the way) a known ſin I underſtand to be, not only that which is actually apprehended, or preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged by our ſelves to be a ſin; but that which is contrary to our habitual knowledg, or received principles, though we ſhould not apply them to its condemnation actually: yea, whatſoever we have ſo ſufficient and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to be convinced of to be a ſin, that if it were not for our affection to the ſin, and our diſaffection to the light, that would detect us in it, and draw us from it, it would be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough to us that it is a ſin. And if there ſhould be any that will not allow the latter branch of this deſcription of a known ſin, yet I dare affirm to him, that a ſin even ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, may juſtly prove ſuch a skreen or vail as I am ſpeaking of.

That ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to a manifeſt ſin is of this obſtructing

                     <hi>theſe men have ſet up their Idols in their heart, and put the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block of their iniquity before their face; ſhould I be enquired of at all by them?</hi> Here we have certain of <hi>the Elders of Iſrael</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to the Prophet, and ſitting be ore him: their buſineſs is to enquire of the Lord, or (as it is termed after) <hi>to enquire of the Prophet concerning the Lord;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Verſe 7</note> to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God with what they deſired to know concerning God, his Will, and ways: but the poſture they come in, is the matter which the Lord takes notice of more then the errand which they come about; and this is quite ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that: <hi>Theſe men have ſet up their Idols in their heart, &amp;c.</hi> This is the thing which puts a ſtop to their enquiry: here comes in the skreen or traverſe which interpoſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and their buſineſs. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſin indulged brings this about two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Efficiently. 2. Meritoriouſly. And both are in this Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Efficiently: ſin diſtempereth the heart that it cannot take in, or receive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It provoketh God, that he will not give anſwer, or ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Efficiently: It diſtempereth or indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the heart for the receiving of an anſwer; <hi>Their Idols are ſet up in their heart, and the ſtumbling block of their iniquity is put before
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169943:124"/> their face:</hi> that is, there is a prepoſſeſſion of their heart, and ſight by their ſin; it is gotten into the heart before-hand, and there it hath the uppermoſt ſeat or throne; it is the Lady or Miſtriſs, it is the Idol or Goddeſs there: And <hi>it is before their face;</hi> it hath taken up the whole ſcope and region of their eye-ſight, it covers all before them; and this is with their own conſent and will, it is their own doing; they have ſo ſet it up in their heart, ſo put it before their face: they have been otherwiſe taught and inſtructed, they have been often and plainly detected of, and rebuked for thoſe their ſins, yet they will ſtill ſet and keep them up in their hearts, and before their faces; their affection, favor, and regard is to them; and this ſets them up againſt all the clear lights and admonitions of Gods Word: their ſin we ſee is of a blinding nature to them, and they blindfold themſelvs with it. The <hi>Law</hi> ſaith of a gift,<note place="margin">Deu. 16.19</note> that <hi>it blindeth the eyes of the wiſe, and perverteth the words of the righteous:</hi> this it doth by raiſing the affections, which, like a ſteam or miſt about a candle, dim the eyes of the underſtanding. So it is in the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of every other ſin, as well as in that of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: We ſay, affection is blind, love to ſin doth deprive the ſight, and deprave the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when an inquiſition is paſſing, the right cannot be diſcerned. There is a place ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full and ſuitable to this, in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 44.18</note> 
                     <hi>They have not known nor underſtood, for he hath ſhut their eyes that they cannot
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169943:124"/> ſee, and their hearts that they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. He hath ſhut,</hi> that is, their <hi>Idol,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of immediately before. The Prophet there, and in the diſcourſe thereabout, doth excellently ſet forth the infatuating and intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating nature of Idolatry, (and every luſt-ſerving ſin is real Idolatry,) how unreaſonable, ſtupid and ſenſleſs it makes the followers of it; how it prevails, not only to tempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them to its committance, but to bind and block up their ſenſes and reaſon from all diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their extream folly in it; ſo that they cannot once reflect upon or entertain a thought of their dotage therein, though it be never ſo palpable: And this place is ſufficient to make good the deſcription I gave before of a known ſin: we cannot expect, to the making of it ſuch, that a man do actually apprehend, and own, and yield it to be a ſin: It is in the next words ſaid of theſe men, <hi>None conſidereth in his heart,</hi> (or, as it is read) <hi>none ſetteth it on,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 19</note> 
                     <hi>or returneth, or reduceth it to his heart; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there knowledg or underſtanding to ſay, I have burnt part of it in the fire, &amp;c.</hi> This phraſe, <hi>none conſidereth, or ſetteth on to his hearth,</hi> gives us the ſence of thoſe words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, wherein they are ſaid to have no knowledg or underſtanding of what they did; to wit, they had not the practical applicative, or actual knowing; habitual knowledg, principles out of which to deduce an act of judgment, they had; for the Prophet there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly proves, what they did was againſt
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169943:125"/> Natures light, common Reaſon, and ordinary ſenſe: and therefore in the following words he ſaith, <hi>Remember theſe, O Iacob, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: Remember,</hi> there wanted no more but an act of remembrance, or calling in, out of the ſtorehouſe of the memory, that which was there already layd up, and was ſufficient to ſhew them the whole truth of that matter. But to return to the point: here it is evident that the cauſe of the <hi>Lords</hi> hiding himſelf may be near at hand, may be in the very hearts, and before the faces of men, and yet they not ſee, nor conſider it; that is, they ſee it not to be a cauſe of ſuch an evil: the thing they ſee, and own, and that too much; but they underſtand no ſuch cauſality, or effect by it: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they do not, is, the darkening and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding efficacy that their Idolized ſin hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The more men ſet up their ſin in their heart, and put it before their face, as an Idol, to wit, in affection and regard; the more it is out of their mind and ſight, in reſpect of entitling or attributing to it the miſchief that it doth them: they cannot ſee, or find it out, in point of cauſing and procuring that evil to them, becauſe they look and fix too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in point of love and affection. It is truly that <hi>beam in their eye, which is not conſidered:</hi> it is therefore not conſidered becauſe it is in their own eye: it is too near to be noted; and being ſo cloſe to them, it not only ſcapes eſpying but it is the impediment that they cannot ſee any thing elſe as they ought. Thus any allowed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169943:125"/> ſin is a blind or skreen againſt the enquiry we we are upon, by way of efficiency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth it Meritoriouſly, or by way of provocation; it moveth God to deny an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: and this is in the next words, <hi>Should I be enquired of at all by them? q. d.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that ſuch perſons ſhould come and enquire of me, and if they do adventure upon it, it ſhall be in vain: This advancement of their Idols, and iniquities in their heart, and before their face, doth mightily incenſe God; and he takes their coming to enquire of him, in this conjunction with their ſin, as a very high preſumption, and daring affront, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity put upon him; and for it he refuſeth and repulſeth their enquiry with indignation. Suitable to this rejection is that in <hi>Daniel;</hi> when the Church of God (whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian, whether under <hi>Antiochus</hi> or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, I ſhall not here diſpute) ſhould be in her time of greateſt trouble, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.4</note> 
                     <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro;</hi> to wit, to underſtand the riſe and continuance of thoſe doleful afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and the <hi>Angel</hi> informs the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> that their enquiry ſhould be of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſucceſs, according to the difference of the enquirers:<note place="margin">Verſ. 10</note> 
                     <hi>None of the wicked ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand:</hi> and the reaſon why <hi>none of the wicked ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> is immediately foregoing, becauſe <hi>the wicked ſhall do wickedly;</hi> for their wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it ſhall be that they ſhall be left deſtitute of underſtanding in theſe Times: they may
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169943:126"/> run to and fro, but it will be but (as it is in the Pſalmiſt) <hi>like a dog,</hi> with an unſatisfied mind; and the reaſon is, becauſe they <hi>go round about, like the dog,</hi> to purſue their ſinful luſts with greedineſs.</p>
                  <p>Yea, it may be obſerved, this retaining and perſiſtency in their ſin, when they come to conſult with God, not only fruſtrateth their ſeeking unto him, by provoking him to deny them reſolution, but it procureth a further ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from God, as the words following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; and it is of two parts: 1. A penal tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or delivery of them up to deceits and deluſions:<note place="margin">Verſ. 4</note> 
                     <hi>I the Lord will anſwer him that cometh according to the multitude of his Idols: q. d.</hi> He ſhall not only be denyed that anſwer which he would have, and I would give, if he were an obedient and ſincere ſeeker of me; that is, a friendly and ſatisfying ſolution of his doubt; but he ſhall have an anſwer worſe then none, an anſwer of judgment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: and it ſhall be according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his Idols; that is, as his abominable Idolatries deſerve, and in ſome proportion to that kind of ſin: he ſhall have no better an anſwer then if he were enquiring at his Idols: he ſhall have an Idols anſwer; and that was, indeed, ſometimes a dumb, mute, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs repulſe; as was that of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, in <hi>Elijahs</hi> conteſt with them:<note place="margin">1 King. 18 26</note> but ſometimes it was a doubtful and aenigmatical, or a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right falſe and lying anſwer:<note place="margin">Hab 2.18</note> 
                     <hi>The molten Image is a teacher of lyes: the Idols have
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169943:126"/> ſpoken vanity, and the Diviners have ſeen a lye, and have told falſe dreams.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 10.2 5</note> The anſwer is further deſcribed, <hi>That I may take the houſe of Iſrael in their own heart;</hi> that is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their enquiry ſhall be their catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enſnaring; they ſhall be poſſeſſed with the error and miſpriſion of their own brains, in ſtead of a true revelation from God: and by it they ſhall be held and led on with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as in a net or ſnare, to their own ruine: This ſentence is the ſame, both in effect and in cauſe, with that of the Apoſtle; <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10, 11, 12</note> 
                     <hi>that they ſhould believe a lye:</hi> and wherefore is it? <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs:</hi> and the ſpecial means, by which they ſhould thus fall into the trap, is in the ſubſequent words; <hi>And if the Prophet be deceived,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 9</note> 
                     <hi>when he hath ſpoken a thing, I the Lord have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Prophet:</hi> It ſhould be by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and deceivedneſs of falſe Prophets, whoſe falſhood and deluſion, whether ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or effective, whether in themſelves or in the people, though it be their own ſin (as the peoples deluſion alſo is their own ſin, in that they ſeek to, and credit ſuch Prophets) yet it is alſo penal; and ſo from God, not by active infuſion, but by giving them up to Satan, his inſtruments and engines, to themſelves, and their own ſtumbling blocks.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other part of the ſentence is,<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>I the Lord will anſwer him by my ſelf, and I will
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169943:127"/> ſet my face againſt that man, and will make him a ſign and proverb; and I will cut him off from the midſt of my people:</hi> Here is ſtill more weight added to the puniſhment of the preſumptuous ſinner, that dares enquire of God with his heart upon his ſin; he ſhall, not only be denyed a favorable and reſolving anſwer from God, nor only, beſides that, be given up by God to others and his own deceits, but he ſhall have thereto an immediate, poſitive return from God: and it is an heavy one; <hi>it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much:</hi> it is a moſt dreadful thing for a man to have the face of God ſet againſt him; it is one of the terribleſt expreſſions in the whole Scripture: and he that will ſeek to God, but will not ſincerely ſet himſelf towards him, to ſeek his face, but will keep up the ſtumbling block of his iniquity before his own face, he muſt look for this return. Therefore it behoves every one, not only in relation to the well-ſpeeding of his enquiry in this, or any other matter, but in reference to all other his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to that deareſt concernment of his own Soul, that there be an unfeigned parting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his iniquity. To cloſe up then this Rule, let that admonition of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, annexed to the rebuke and ſentence I have been inſiſting on in this place, be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and followed;<note place="margin">Verſ. 6</note> which is this: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay unto the Houſe of Iſrael, thus ſaith the Lord God, Repent and turn your ſelves from your Idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations:</hi> and let us, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169943:127"/> with this, remember that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. when the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had diſcourſed <hi>of the great, honorable, glorious, and wonderful works of God,</hi> and of the duty of <hi>ſearching them out,</hi> he concludeth with this ſentence, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way thereto, (and with it I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this particular,) <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom; a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have all they which do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other two Rules there are, which I ſhall diſpatch ſhortly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Come to the enquiry with an humble heart: 1. With an heart-humbled under this condition (of Gods hiding himſelf from us in relation to prayer) according to the nature of it, and as it deſerves. We have great reaſon to take it very heavily: The Lords hiding from his ſervants, or from his Church, hath ever been the matter of their deepeſt hearts-piercing, bittereſt ſorrow, and dolefulleſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: So it was to <hi>Job,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 30.28</note> to <hi>Heman. Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I went mourning without the Sun;</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <head type="sub">A Conſideration of the means of receiving Reſolution in this Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>WE have ſeen ſome Rules concerning the manner of addreſſing our ſelves to the Query propounded: let me now add ſomething by way of conſideration, touching the way or means by which ſatisfaction is to be fought and received: Concerning which take theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reſolution of this queſtion belongeth unto God, it can only be had from him; his place and prerogative it is to unty this knot, to return anſwer to this Query. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to the two Officers of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> concerning
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169943:129"/> Dreams,<note place="margin">Gen. 40.8</note> 
                     <hi>Do not Interpretations belong to God?</hi> So may I in this caſe; 'Tis true, all things whatſoever, both the Being and the knowledg of them, cometh from God, but the underſtanding of this matter proceedeth from him in a more peculiar manner: it lies not within the reach of natural principles, the perſpicacity or induſtry of humane wit cannot make this diſcovery. <hi>Elihu,</hi> going to ſpeak unto that diſpute which was betwixt <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends (one branch whereof was this caſe of prayer now in hand with us) he prefaceth this as a maxim, <hi>Surely there is a ſpirit in man, but the inspiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty maketh them to underſtand: q. d.</hi> Though man have a reaſonable Soul, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive faculty in him, yet he cannot attain to the true knowledg and determination of this difference without the illumination of Gods Spirit. A reaſon of his own action, and of ſuch an action as is not reducible to the courſe of Nature, or his general Providence, but is of the number of his ſpecial Diſpenſations, God alone can give; he only (by the ways and helps himſelf hath aſſigned) is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of for it. Sometimes (I acknowledg) the caſe may be ſo plain, as even the light of Nature may ſee ſome reaſon for this effect. The Scripture ſaith, the cauſes of the plagues and deſolations upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſo evident (when God ſhould have executed them) that all the paſſers by, and the Heathen Nations ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, ſhould be able to ſee, and render a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169943:130"/> reaſon of them<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 29 25 1 Kin. 9.9 Jer. 22.9</note>: and this is ſpoken in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the Lords hiding his face from the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 39 23</note>. But every caſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſo apparent as that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might be; and if it were, yet however this infringeth not what I have ſaid of the appropriatedneſs unto God of the reſolution of this queſtion: For, 1. Though ſome groſs ſins, which may provoke God to this hiding of himſelf, may be diſcovered by a natural Conſcience, as the cauſe thereof; yet all the cauſes which there may be (I ſpeak not of ſecret cauſes which we may not pry into, but of thoſe that are enquirable) cannot be that way deſcryed. 2. What ever in this kind may be humanely diſcernable, it is God alone that can make known the whole truth in this matter unto conviction, and ſo, as men concerned it ſhall actually acknowledg and ſubſcribe unto it. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> telleth <hi>Jobs</hi> friends (after all their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with him were done) <hi>There is none of you that convinced Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 32.12, 13</note> 
                     <hi>or that anſwered his words: leſt you ſhould ſay, We have found out wiſdom: God thruſteth him down, not man.</hi> Theſe laſt words <hi>Iunius</hi> renders, <hi>the ſtrong God ſhall drive him down, not man:</hi> that is, as if he had ſaid, It is not the work of any man ſo to argue with <hi>Job</hi> as to evince him, or to drive or beat him out of his opinion; but there needs a divine power to do it. It is ſolely appertaining to God, ſo to make known a thing, as to make men know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it,<note place="margin">Job 36.22</note> and ſit down ſatisfied in it: <hi>Who
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169943:130"/> teacheth like him?</hi> (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith after:) Whoſe inſtruction hath that power and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to convince as his hath? Again, ſaith the ſame perſon, <hi>He openeth the ears of men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 16.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſealeth their inſtruction: He openeth</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the ears,</hi> ſo that men do receive and regard what he ſaith; and <hi>he ſealeth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> ſo that it takes impreſſion upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſalving of this Query being to come from God, we are to look about for the means by which he imparteth, and men receive it from him. The means which the Scripture mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, are of two ſorts, extraordinary, &amp; ordinary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The people of God have ſometimes been afforded extraordinary means. When the Lord hath any way withdrawn, or hid himſelf from his people, and the queſtion hath been, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was? he hath revealed to them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon extraordinarily, as ſometimes by Utim<note n="a" place="margin">Joſh. 7.10 2 Sam. 21.1</note>, ſometimes by Lot<note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 14 37, 40.</note>, ſometimes by a Prophet<note n="c" place="margin">Judg. 6 7 8. Jer. 16.10. Amos 3.7.</note>. But theſe ways we are now deſtitute of; we now have no warrant (that I know) to expect or make uſe of any ſuch means.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But, though ſuch ways of Gods diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his mind in this matter be ceaſed to us, yet God hath not given over ſpeaking to his people; but he ſtill makes known unto them (by the means he thinks fitteſt) the Rule and Reaſon (in ſome ſort) by which he walks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. In our preſent diſtractions and obſcurities, although we have not a <hi>Samuel</hi> now (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> once had in their Aſſembly at <hi>Gilgal</hi>) to ſay to us by immediate and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169943:131"/> commiſſion from God (as he then to them<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12 7</note>,) <hi>Stand ſtill, that I may reaſon with you of all the righteous acts of the Lord;</hi> by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us (as he did to them) what great things God had done from time to time for us; and what evil returns we have made to him; and what therefore he hath done againſt us; and what the cauſes of his ſo doing have been in particular; and to confirm his diſceptation by a miraculous ſign from Heaven, that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our confeſſion (as did <hi>Samuel</hi> upon <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 16.29</note>) Yet we have <hi>Moſes and the Prophets to hear:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 8.20.</note> we have <hi>the Law and the Teſtimony to repair to:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1 12.</note> we have <hi>that more ſure word of Prophecy whereunto to take heed:</hi> we have <hi>the holy Scriptures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15</note> 
                     <hi>which are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> to furniſh us. This is the means by which God now layeth forth his ways, and the grounds of them (ſo far as he ſees good to reveal them) to us. In the written Word of God there are divine Declarations, that for ſuch and ſuch cauſes God will hide himſelf from prayers: There are Hiſtories and Narrations of times and caſes wherein, and of perſons from whom, and of reaſons for which God hath withdrawn himſelf: There are alſo Recognitions and acknowledgments of men, both that ſuch hath been the proceeding of God towards them or others, and wherefore it hath been: and of all thoſe, and all other Scripture Declarations, Hiſtories and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,<note place="margin">Rom 15, 4</note> it is ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169943:131"/> Theſe things were our examples. All theſe things happened to them for enſamples;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.6 11</note> 
                     <hi>and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> The proper and direct end of the putting of theſe upon divine Record, clearly was, that as Urim, Lots, and Prophets, ſpeaking with lively voyce, were to them of former ages (unto whom they were afforded) in ſtead of Scripture; ſo the Scripture now ſhould be to us in ſtead of Urim, Lots, and Prophets ſpeaking; and that thoſe things which were once delivered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration to ſome perſons, and on particular occaſions, ſhould ſtill retain an infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and an expreſs voyce to give informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generally unto all, and in every caſe.</p>
                  <p>But to underſtand God ſpeaking to us in his Word: Among thoſe many Reaſons which Scripture layeth down of Gods hiding in this behalf, to diſcern which of them more ſpecially belongs to our caſe, this is a matter of ſome skill; and indeed herein lies the knot of the enquiry. We are apt, as in other, ſo in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to miſapply; to take hold on that in Scripture which fits not us, and to paſs over that which appertaineth to us; to catch at that which ſpeaks not, and to be deaf to that which doth ſpeak to us. Any better courſe for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us right in this regard I cannot think of, then that of the Pſalmiſt, in the 73 <hi>Pſalm;</hi> when he was come to a loſs in his enquiry (the which was ſomewhat alyed to this of ours,) <hi>when he thought to know the thing, and it was
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169943:132"/> too painful for him, he went into the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God,</hi> and there he underſtood the bottom of his query.</p>
                  <p>This way, if well followed and practiſed, may alſo ſtand us in good ſtead in the ſearch in hand. That entering into the Sanctuary of God, and approach unto God therein, is of ſuch avail, <hi>David</hi> will inform us elſewhere. <hi>Thy way, O God, is in the Sanctuary:</hi> And again, <hi>They have ſeen thy goings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 77 13 68 24</note> 
                     <hi>O God, even the goings of my God, my King, in the Sanctuary.</hi> The proceedings of God toward his people (with all that concerning them is requiſite to be underſtood) are to be learned in his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: for this reaſon it may be that it is called <hi>the place of his feet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 60.13 Ezek. 43.7</note> and <hi>the place of the ſoles of his feet;</hi> that is, the place where the tracts or prints of his feet may be found out, ſo far as they are knowable. Hence it is that whereas <hi>David</hi> makes this <hi>one thing</hi> among many, and above others, <hi>which he had deſired of the Lord, and would ſeek after,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4.</note> to wit, <hi>that he might dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of his life;</hi> his end in it was, <hi>to behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore conſider, a little, what this <hi>entering into the Sanctuary of God</hi> may mean; or, what it may import to us. There were three conſtant and principal errands or occaſions for which the people of God were to go into the Sanctuary of God. 1. For Attonement, or Reconciliation with God by ſacrifice. 2. For Prayer. 3. For Inſtruction in the written
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169943:132"/> Word of God. What the moral of theſe is to us, will be eaſily gathered. Would we then be helped at this loſs, or ſtop? Would we hear and underſtand what God the Lord ſpeaks to us out of his Word? Would we take out of it that portion which properly belongs to us? Would we have the Book of God to open (as it were) in the fit place,<note place="margin">Luke 4.17 <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Confeſſ. l. 8. c. 12.</note> as ſometimes it did to our Saviour, and as it is reported to have done once to holy <hi>Auguſtine?</hi> Let us enter into the Sanctuary of God, that is, put in practiſe theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seek we Peace and Reconciliation with God in the pardon of our ſins, through that one, only, real, and ſufficient Sacrifice of Chriſts Death. The Lord promiſeth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that at the door of the Tabernacle, where the continual burnt-offering was offered up upon the Altar,<note place="margin">Exod. 29.42, 43.</note> 
                     <hi>there he would meet with them, and he would ſpeak there unto them. David,</hi> in the 51 Pſalm, that his penitential Pſalm, earneſtly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God for pardon of ſin, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall promiſe to himſelf, <hi>that in the hidden part God ſhould make him to know wiſdom;</hi> yea, in that meaſure to know it, that he ſhould be able to teach others the ways of God. And,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.4, 5, 7, 11.</note> in another Pſalm, petitioning God <hi>to ſhew him his ways, to teach him his paths, and lead him in his truth;</hi> he annexeth (as in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) his requeſts, <hi>that the Lord would not remember the ſins of his youth, nor his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; and that he would for his Names ſake pardon his iniquity.</hi> It may be obſerved,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169943:133"/> that in the day of the Prophet <hi>Daniels</hi> ſolemn humiliation and prayer,<note place="margin">Dan. 9, 19, &amp;c.</note> and in the cloſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, immediately (as it ſeems) upon thoſe words of his, <hi>O Lord, hear, O Lord, forgive, &amp;c.</hi> the man <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to him, and informed him concerning the counſel of God, delivering to him that revelation of the <hi>ſeventy weeks.</hi> And, it deſerves to be well taken notice of,<note place="margin">Iſai. 54.8, 9, 11 Jer. 33.34. Heb 8.11, 12</note> that in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> the benefit of being <hi>taught of God,</hi> and <hi>of the abounding of the knowledg of God,</hi> is joyned with the removal of Gods wrath, and the forgiveneſs of ſins and iniquities. Let it be our firſt care then to ſeek and obtain reconciliation with God, and expiation of ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us go unto God by Prayer, and make this a ſpecial petition unto him, that he would diſcloſe his mind, and give us wiſdom in this particular. Doth the Lord hide himſelf from our prayers? ſet we our ſelves to prayer ſo much the more cloſely. It is recorded of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.41 44.</note> that when he was in the <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and at prayer, <hi>being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly.</hi> And let us for this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeek unto God, to know the reaſon of his hiding of himſelf; that reaſon (I mean) which it behoveth us to know, and he would have us ſeek after. <hi>David,</hi> in his exile, and want of God,<note place="margin">Pſal 42.9.</note> ſaith, <hi>I will ſay unto God, My Rock, why haſt thou forgotten me? why go I mourning becauſe of the oppreſſion of the enemy?</hi> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> adviſeth <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 34.31 32</note> 
                     <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169943:133"/> offend any more; that which I ſee not, teach thou me.</hi> And this <hi>Job</hi> himſelf had done, when he ſaid unto God,<note place="margin">Chap. 10.2</note> 
                     <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me:</hi> And again, where he faith, <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſins?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 13.23, 24</note> 
                     <hi>Make me to know my tranſgreſſion and ſin. Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine enemy?</hi> Let that be our courſe in this doubt which was the courſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>three children,</hi> for the finding out of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars dream,</hi> namely,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.18, 19</note> 
                     <hi>to deſire mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the God of Heaven concerning this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</hi> This way ſucceeded with them: for, <hi>then was the ſecret revealed to Daniel in a night viſion.</hi> And we may hope the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (though not by the ſame means) may be unto us. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 28 5</note> 
                     <hi>Evil men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not judgment; but they that ſeek the Lord underſtand all things.</hi> This is the way directed unto by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> and unto it he gives us a promiſe;<note place="margin">Jam. 1 5.</note> 
                     <hi>If any of you lack wiſd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, let him ask of God, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſeth the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this, as both the ſin, and the prejudice of his people then in captivity, in this regard: <hi>All this evil is come upon us;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9 13.</note> 
                     <hi>yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and underſtand thy Truth.</hi> To underſtand Gods Truth here, I conceive, intendeth the practical and particular underſtanding of the congruity of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings then in Judgment with them, with his Word, in the threatenings pronounced by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:169943:134"/> and the Prophets; and the applicative knowledg or acknowledgment of the verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe denunciations upon them; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an attributing of their deſolations to theſe evil ways of theirs; againſt which the Prophets had before declared them. And the reaſon why they had not underſtood this truth of God, was, <hi>they had not made their prayer unto God, that they might turn from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and underſtand this truth.</hi> Where, by the way, you may note the neceſſity of that which I inſiſted on before, in the Rules given, to wit, turning from our iniquities, to the end we may know Gods truth, manifeſted in his dealings with us. The people of the Jews had made their prayer, after their manner, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and during the ſeventy years captivity; but they had not made their prayer with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from their iniquities; and therefore they had not attained to underſtand the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid truth in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>But, to conclude this particular, if God do hide himſelf from our prayers, we are to pray to him, that the reaſon of it may not be hidden from us; and that, if it ſeemeth good unto him, for a time to make a ſtop of our other prayers, yet he would not deny us in this, but herein diſcover his intention to us, that ſo we may both the more contentedly ſtay, and make the better uſe of his delaying or denying of us in the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Attend diligently to the written Word. We have before ſhewed the Scripture to be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169943:134"/> (now) the only ordinary means of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of theſe ways of God towards us; and that the common or main difficulty that is obvious to us on the part of this means, is, whereas God revealeth to men in his Word variety of Reaſons for this, according to the variety of Caſes, how to know or pitch upon that which in ſpecial concerns us and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and that, in order to the clearing our ſelves of this difficulty, we are to get into terms of peace and reconciliation with God, we are particularly to pray for ſpecial information herein of God: Now unto theſe we muſt thirdly add, a cloſe and cordial inſpection into the Word: Conſcience muſt here awaken, come in, and diligently do its office; and that is, not only to open and acquaint us with the whole rule or dictate of Scripture, but to make uſe, application, or deduction from it to our ſelves: and this conſiſts mainly, if not only, in taking a diſtinct and right view of our caſe; or, in bringing in a true and full account, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or judgment of the matter of fact.</p>
                  <p>This matter of fact hath two parts: 1. Gods dealing with us. 2. Our own ways towards him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A ſtrict and narrow inſight into a ſerious conſideration of Gods dealing with us muſt be had: <hi>Come, behold the works of the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 46.8.</note> 
                     <hi>what deſolations he hath made in the Earth.</hi> Every Providence of God (eſpecially his more notable acts) hath a reaſon written upon it,<note place="margin">Eze. 14.23</note> could mans eye read it: And the due eying of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169943:135"/> the ways of God is a great means to bring to light that reaſon. The contemplation of Gods proceedings is hereunto apt, in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By vertue of that ſimilitude or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which often there is (eſpecially in croſſes) betwixt Gods dealings with men, and their dealings afore with him: And this is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be found in Gods walking towards us in relation to prayer. As <hi>Solomon</hi> hath it in his prayer at the dedication of the Temple:<note place="margin">1 Kings 8.39</note>

                     <hi>and as a wayfaring man that turneth aſide to tarry for a night? Why ſhouldſt thou be as a man aſtonied, as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man that cannot ſave?—Thus ſaith the Lord unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the Lord doth not accept them, &amp;c.</hi> Here the people of <hi>Judah</hi> are by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> perſonated in a complaint of Gods withdrawing from them; and the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his reply unto them by way of reddition of a reaſon, wherefore he did it: <hi>Thus have they loved to wander: q. d.</hi> They complain of me, that (notwithſtanding the relation they are in unto me, of my people) I am as a ſtranger, or a night-lodger, as a wearied man, or as a ſtrong
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169943:135"/> man whoſe power is overmatched, in that I do not hear and ſave them: they may ſee, if they will, why it is, and what's the matter I am ſo ſtrange and helpleſs to them; what it is that makes me diſlodg and be gone from among them; and, while I ſtay, to be as a man alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unconcerned in their condition: <hi>Thus have they loved to wander:</hi> Right as I carry to them, ſo have they to me; they have eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves, and run away from me, after their Idols; ſo that they may ſay, <hi>like ſin, like puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By vertue of that ſenſe and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efficacy which the works of God (of this ſort more eſpecially) are apt to introduce upon the Conſcience: As in the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> it is ſaid of the Jews, upon their captivity,<note place="margin">Zech. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>And they returned, and ſaid, Like as the Lord of Hoaſts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, ſo hath he dealt with us.</hi> This obſervation which they make upon the ways of God towards them, is even wrung out from them by their preſent ſenſe and ſmart under Gods Judgments; and their Conſciences are induced to this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment by the tranſparency of the hand of God upon them. In this reſpect the Judgments of God are <hi>as the light that goeth forth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.5.</note> or <hi>the morning light;</hi> of force to awaken and rouze up thoſe men that lie aſleep in their beds of ſenſleſs ſecurity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other branch of the matter of fact is, our own ways towards God. <hi>Let us ſearch
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169943:136"/> and try our ways,</hi> ſaith the afflicted Church of <hi>Judah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.40</note> upon this very occaſion, of the Lords <hi>covering himſelf with a cloud, that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could not paſs through.</hi>

If we will let our own courſes go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearched, it is but ſuitable that the proceedings of God ſhould remain hidden to us. When any evil of affliction is upon us, as God always brings it, ſo there is ſtill a reaſon for it on our part; there is a cauſe ever extant in us; there is always ſomething in us that calleth for it; either ſomething that needeth it, or ſomething that procureth it: and, if we ſeem deſirous to know the cauſe of an evil we lie under, and will not ſearch, and ſoundly ſearch where it is, we deſerve not to find it.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The Queſtion divided into its parts; and the Cauſes of Gods hiding from Prayers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</head>
                  <p>WE have hitherto been detained at the threſhold of this queſtion (but it hath been ſomewhat neceſſarily) by taking a view of the impediments ariſing in the way, the manner how to addreſs unto, and the means by which to gain ſatisfaction in it: it is now time to enter upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion hath two parts: 1. What may be the reaſon of Gods hiding himſelf from his peoples prayers grounded upon his Promiſes? 2. What may be the reaſon of his ſeeming by his providences to anſwer the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are contrary unto them? although the former be the main, and that being reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be in effect the reſolution of the latter.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt, to wit, What may be the reaſon of Gods hiding himſelf from his peoples prayers grounded upon his promiſes? The intent of this Query (as I take it) is not meerly to ask, in the general, what at any time or in any caſe may be the reaſon of the ſaid ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? but particularly, what may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now, and as the caſe ſtands with us? yet it will be firſt very requiſite, and a good part of our work, to deal with the queſtion in its general ſtate; that is, to ſurvey the whole
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169943:137"/> 
                     <hi>ſeries,</hi> or predicament of cauſes of this effect, which the Scripture gives us; and then we may proceed to the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> or the caſe as it is preſent and proper to us.</p>
                  <p>It will be requiſite (I ſay) and make much towards the clearing of the Query, to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſum up all the reaſons (ſo far as we can collect them) which the Word diſcovers to us of the Lords hiding from the prayers of his people grounded upon his promiſes: and, in ſo doing to take (in this general account) thoſe notions [<hi>of Gods people, and of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers groundedneſs upon the Promiſes]</hi> in the larger ſence, namely, to include all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are the people of God by outward profeſſion and calling; and all the prayers of ſuch, which may be ſaid to be grounded on the Promiſes, in regard of the matter prayed for, though they be deficient in the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary: For, 1. Though the caſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our eye is intent, be but one, yet the reaſons that have influence into it may be many. 2. Among the many reaſons in Scripture for the over clouding of prayer, ſome (in this particular caſe) may belong to ſome perſons more directly and peculiarly, and other to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it may avail therefore to have all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. 3. If we come ſhort in the unfolding of the preſent caſe ſet before us (as infallibly and perfectly to open it I muſt be far from promiſing,) yet to have gone thus far will be an advantage; for when we have a collection of what reaſons are poſſible to come within
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:169943:137"/> our caſe layd before us, then each mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may ſet it ſelf on work; and we have the enquiry, with the rule to go by, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hand, as in a Syſtems or Anatome. 4. Though there be much difference betwixt Gods hiding from the prayers of the faithful ſeekers of him, and his hiding from thoſe of the hypocrite, in reſpect of manner or degree; yet there may be, and is too often, a co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, in reſpect of cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons or cauſes which the Scripture rendereth for the Lords hiding from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayers may be reduced to two heads: They are ariſing either from man or from God; they are ſuch as are either given by man, or propoſed and aymed at by God; or they are either meritorious cauſes, or final cauſes; that is, they are either the ungracious procurements and provocations of man, or the gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments and purpoſes of God. 1. There are cauſes ariſing from man, thoſe which he giveth; this effect is promerited and procured by him; there is in him that which provoketh God to it. 2. There are cauſes ariſing from God, final cauſes, merciful ends, purpoſes and deſigns propoſed, and aymed at by him. The former ſort of cauſes makes the hiding penal, the latter makes it profitable; by the one it is vindictive, by the other it is beneficial.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall inſiſt on theſe two ſeverally: but there is one thing that would firſt be denoted concerning them both together, which is, that theſe two ſorts of cauſes may ſometimes go
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169943:138"/> alone, or apart, or the one may be ſevered from the other; ſometimes again they may concur or go conjoyned.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes, or in ſome caſes, they may be found apart, or alone, or the one without the other; and that both ways, to wit, this without that, and that without this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One while God may be obſerved to do this (namely to hide himſelf from prayer) for the demerit or delinquency of the party pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, without any ground of gathering his reſpect therein to any gracious ends towards or for them:<note place="margin">Prov. 1.28</note> as in that of <hi>Solomon; Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me:</hi> Here the hiding may be meerly penal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another while it may be for certain gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends, which God hath to accompliſh thereby on, or for them that pray, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any ſpecial provocation of theirs: as in the Churches caſe,<note place="margin">Pſa. 44.17 &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>They were covered with the ſhadow of death: God</hi> (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſenſe) <hi>was aſleep, had caſt them off, did hide his face, and forget their affliction and oppreſſion:</hi> yet they ſay, <hi>all this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we delt falſly in thy Covenant; our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way:</hi> And this appears to be <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, his own words ſo report it; <hi>Behold I go forward,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 23.8, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169943:138"/> behold him: he hideth himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him: but when he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth as gold: my foot hath held his ſteps, his way have I kept and not declined, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe caſes the hiding may be conceived not penal at all, but meerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curative of their good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes thoſe two ſorts of reaſons may concur, or be conjoyned in this effect: And this may be two ways:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either diſtributely, or with relation to ſeveral perſons joyned together in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and in the ſame prayers; that is, it may be that the Lord may hide himſelf from the joynt prayers of a ſociety of men, ſo, as that to ſome of them it may be only for their demerits, and ſo meerly penal; to others of them it may be from merciful intentions in God, and ſo conducing to their benefit. We read in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the <hi>people of Judah</hi> were diſtinguiſhed by God into two parties, by the emblem of <hi>two baskets of figs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 24.1, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>the one whereof had very good, the other had very naughty figs in it:</hi> by the former were figured thoſe of <hi>Jehojakims</hi> and <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; by the latter thoſe of <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> both theſe ſorts, that is, all the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the the whole Nation generally prayed (as I have made evident before,) and for teſtimony of it, take the places in the margent<note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 21.1 2.36 9 37 3.42.1, &amp;c. Ezek. 14 1 &amp;c. Zech. 7.5</note>: and as they all ſought unto God, ſo did God hide himſelf (in reſpect of a prevention, or inſtant return of the captivity) from the prayers of them all,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169943:139"/> both of the one ſort and the other: But it was with this difference (as it is in that Prophecy of the Figs,) thoſe reſembled by the good figs, though they were carryed and kept in that captivity, it was <hi>for their good</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious ends to be thereby accompliſhed to them, which you may ſee in that Text<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 6, 7</note>. Thoſe noted by the naughty figs were delivered up to the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar for their hurt,</hi> and that many ways, as may be read to that Prophecy<note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 9, 10</note>; and ſo it was unto them purely for puniſhment. Here then is a hiding from prayer upon both thoſe ſorts of reaſons diſtributively referred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or it may be individually, or with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſame perſons: The hiding of God from prayers may be for reaſons of both thoſe kinds reſpecting the ſame parties, to wit, both for their provocation and unto the effecting of happy ends to them; it may be both for the ſins and for the good of the ſelf-ſame perſons: for their ſins, as the procuring cauſe on their part; and for their good, as the purpoſed end on Gods part. <hi>Daniel</hi> was one of thoſe good figs afore ſpoken of, he was one of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakims</hi> captivity; and of it alſo were <hi>the three children:</hi> and either of that, or of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniahs</hi> captivity were <hi>Mordecai, Ezra, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> and all thoſe, who being carryed to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> were after the ſeventy years ſet free, and brought to <hi>Iudea,</hi> (for of <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation none were to return<note n="d" place="margin">Or; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a very few; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Jer.</hi> 24 10 with 44, 28.</note>, they were the basket of naughty figs that were to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:169943:139"/> from off the Land,</hi>) and being ſo, they all belonged to <hi>the basket of the good figs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 24.20</note> and conſequently God did hide himſelf from them (in regard of, and during that captivity) for their good; yet it was alſo for their ſins, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledg<note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 9.8 16 Ezr. 9.7.13 Neh. 9 33 37.

                  <p>HAving made this obſervation of both the ſorts of Cauſes layd together, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſpeak of them ſeverally. 1. Of the former, namely, the Reaſons ariſing from man, or the meritorious Cauſes on mans part. Concerning this head of Reaſons, I ſhall endeavor to ſhew four things. 1. That ſin is a cauſe of Gods hiding from his peoples prayers. 2. Whoſe ſins. 3. What ſpecial ſins for kind. 4. Certain circumſtances in ſin that help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this effect.</p>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169943:141"/> and that God himſelf ſhould firſt be vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ſin expiated and removed, and we our ſelves ſet right in the Court of Heaven, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our repentance, ere our prayers for us ſhould have a hearing and return from God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next thing is, Whoſe ſin it is that may cauſe God to hide himſelf from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants prayers? I anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is very ordinarily their own ſin that do pray. I will give no other inſtances for this then thoſe even now given out of <hi>Iſaiah, Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> the <hi>Lamentations, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Micah;</hi> look but over them again, and you will read in every of them, that, as ſin was the motive of Gods hiding from thoſe prayers, ſo the ſin was theirs whoſe were the prayers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is oftentimes the ſin of others: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theirs for whom the prayer is put up to God: As in the interceſſions of the ſervants of God for others, they may pray for others out of duty to Gods Command, and pious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, and their prayer may be regular, and it may be acceptable to God, and yet the Lord may hide himſelf from it (in regard of granting the benefit to the perſons prayed for;) and the reaſon may be the ſins of thoſe perſons.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.11</note> 
                     <hi>Samuel</hi> cryed unto the Lord all night for <hi>Saul,</hi> but <hi>Sauls</hi> diſobedience, in his expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> ſuffered not <hi>Samuel</hi> to prevail for him.<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.8, 9</note> 
                     <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prayed for <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> when the ſix men, the Executioners of Gods wrath, were ſent out into it, with their
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169943:142"/> deſtroying weapons in their hands; but the full meaſure of the Lands and Cities ſins would not admit of a reſcue, though it was <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that prayed. <hi>Iſraels Golden Calf</hi> ſtood up, and made ſuch a breach for Gods anger againſt them,<note place="margin">Exod 32.31, &amp;c.</note> that though <hi>Moſes his choſen ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in it,</hi> yea and <hi>turned away his wrath,</hi> (as to the deſtroying of them,) yet he could not obtain for them a total remiſſion of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: The Lord anſwered him, <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the day when I viſit, I will viſit their ſin upon them: And the Lord plagued the people, becauſe they had made the Calf, &amp;c.</hi> Many a dear Saint of God, and many a holy prayer of ſuch, hath been non-ſuited in Heaven by the over-poyſing ſins of them for whom they have interceded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or the ſin may be theirs who are in near relation to the perſons prayed for. We may find that ſometimes the wickedneſs of bad friends, or alies, hath made more againſt men, then the prayers of their godly friends could make for them. <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (both very choyce ones, the one for a Prince, the other for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) they both prayed for <hi>Judah</hi> about one time; but the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> were too ſtrong for them both; they are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the prevailing reaſon againſt both their prayers<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 22.15, 16, 17, with 23, 25 26 Jer. 14.19 &amp; 15.1, 2, 3, 4.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing propounded to conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is, What ſins in ſpecial do provoke God to hide himſelf from his peoples prayers?</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:169943:142"/>
                  <p>The Scripture brands a multitude of ſins, by name, and ſpecial note, with this effect: Let us view the particulars: And for that end I will put them into three ranks: 1. Sins againſt Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or duty to God. 2. Sins againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table. 3. Sins in or about Prayer it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sins againſt Piety: Unto this rank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long theſe ſins following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Idolatry, or the ſetting up and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip unto thoſe that are no Gods: For this peruſe that ſtory in <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. In ſhort, it is thus: The Lords anger waxed hot againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he ſold them into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and of the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> The <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> under their oppreſſions and diſtreſſes by them, cry unto the Lord, with confeſſion of their ſin: The Lord anſwers them, That, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after and notwithſtanding many former deliverances from the like evils, they had now <hi>forſaken him, and ſerved other gods, therefore he will deliver them no more; let them go, and cry unto, and be delivered by the gods which they have choſen.</hi> This was the dolorous repulſe which in a day of tribulation they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for their ſins of Idolatry: For this ſin it was that God declared he would <hi>neither hear his people of Judah praying for themſelves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 11.10, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>nor his Prophet Jeremiah praying for them.</hi> See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for this <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Covenant-breaking with God: As in that example I laſt mentioned, of <hi>Judahs and Jeremiahs prayers:</hi> They were rejected for
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:169943:143"/> this, as one cauſe: <hi>The houſe of Judah have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Covenant, which I made with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; therefore, &amp;c. And though they ſhall cry unto me, I will not harken unto them, &amp;c. Therefore pray not thou for this people, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lift up a cry or prayer for them, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Abuſe of Religion to carnal ends: This was the ſin of the <hi>Prophets of Judah,</hi> and for it they are ſentenced with this Judgment: <hi>They make my people to err;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mic. 3.5, 6 7</note> 
                     <hi>they bite with their teeth, and cry peace; and he that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not into their mouths, they even prepare war againſt him: Therefore night ſhall be unto you, that ye ſhall not have a viſion; and it ſhall be dark unto you, that you ſhall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and the Sun ſhall go down over the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the day ſhall be dark over you: Then ſhall the Seers be aſhamed, and the Diviners confounded; yea they ſhall all cover their lips, for there is no anſwer of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Contempt, neglect, waxing weary of, ſlothfulneſs in, or falling off from the ſervice of God.<note place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note> The people in the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> complain, by way of taxing God; <hi>It is vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoaſts?</hi> And wherefore do they thus charge God? what was the cauſe of this obſtruction of their prayers? If they had looked well about them, they might have found it in themſelves, and in thoſe very ſervices which they complained to be diſregarded in; as the Prophet before (in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169943:143"/> the firſt, ſecond, and third Chapters) had made it manifeſt againſt them: They were grown <hi>to despiſe Gods Name; to pollute and account contemptible his Table; to offer the blind, the lame, and the ſick for ſacrifice; to profane the Name of God; to eſteem his ſervice a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to ſnuff at it: the Levites were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the way; they had cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law; they had corrupted the Covenant of Levi: Iudah had profaned the holineſs of the Lord, which he loved from the days of their fathers; they were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray from Gods Ordinances, and had not kept them; they had robbed God, namely, in tythes and offerings.</hi> No marvel their devotions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo vain and unprofitable to themſelves, when they were ſo vile and curtalled, as they were done unto God; they had no worſe then they brought. When <hi>the Spouſe</hi> (in <hi>Solomons</hi> Song) gave her ſelf to ſluggiſhneſs,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.3, 6.</note> and would not ariſe from her bed when ſhe was called up by <hi>her Beloved;</hi> this moved him to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi> from her door, and to abſent himſelf from her, when after ſhe would have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him, and, miſſing, ſought him. <hi>The ſet time for God to favor Sion</hi> (in regarding the prayer of the deſtitute,<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.</note> and in hearing the groaning of the priſoner) is, <hi>when his ſervants take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favor the duſt thereof:</hi> that is (as I underſtand) when the ſight and face of Gods houſe and ſervice is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable to them; and the very duſt, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and meaneſt part of it, is delightſom.</p>

                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:169943:144"/>5. Loathing of, refuſing to harken, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Word of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 28 9 Chap. 1.24 28, 29 30.</note>

What congruity is there, that men ſhould look to be heard of God, when they will not harken to him? Upon theſe terms is audience promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his ſervants:<note place="margin">Joh. 15.7.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Carnal ſecurity, or putting confidence in a temporal portion, as in wealth, ſucceſſes, or advancements. This ſin was <hi>Davids</hi> cloud: <hi>In my prosperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved: Lord,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Mic. 3.1, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Is it not for you to know Judgment? who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones: who alſo eat the fleſh of my people, and ſtay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as fleſh within the cauldron: Then ſhall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them; he will even hide his face from them at that time.</hi> Let men of this quality and crime look to it: As they have their time to act their miſchiefs and cruelties, and may proceed from one degree of violence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until they have even made meat of their inferiors; ſo God hath his time of deſerting them, and of refuſing to hear their cry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. Covetouſneſs: This was one of <hi>Judahs</hi> ſins, and of the bolts that kept out their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from God:<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.57.17</note> 
                     <hi>For the iniquity of his covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth, &amp;c.</hi> A greedy deſire to, and over-faſt holding of earthly things, as it hinders our deſires and affections from aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards to Heaven, ſo it ſtops on prayers from coming downwards from thence, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to us:<note place="margin">Matt. 6, 23 Dr <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> prac.

                  <p n="3">3. The third rank of ſins are thoſe that may be in or about prayer it ſelf: theſe are many: The moſt remarkable may be theſe; 1. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a ſight and diſcovery of the ſins that lie againſt us: The Lord ſaith, <hi>I will go and return unto my place, till they acknowledg their offence, and ſeek my face:</hi> With ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the face of God there muſt go along a finding out, and owning of our ſin, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular our offence, that is, the ſpecial ſin we are moſt guilty in, and moſt ſtands up againſt us before God: We are all readier to ſee our wants then our ſins; like Malefactors before a Judg, apter to petition for a releaſe, then to confeſs our faults. <hi>Ioſhua and the Elders of Iſrael lay upon their faces, and prayed before God,</hi> upon their diſcomfiture as <hi>Ai;</hi> but they were not aware of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin in the accurſed thing: the Lord therefore bids them get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 8.38</note> and go hunt out that. <hi>Solomons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was, that God would <hi>hear what prayer and ſupplication ſoever be made by any man, or by all his people Iſrael, which ſhall know every man the plague of his own heart:</hi> Sin
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169943:146"/> is the plague of the heart; this plague muſt be known that prayer may be heard; and every man muſt know the proper plague or ſin of his own heart: this is <hi>a peſtilence</hi> that too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>walketh in darkneſs,</hi> as to mens taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unhumbledneſs of heart: There is to be in all, eſpecially in our ſolemn and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prayers, an humbled Spirit, in regard of needs, judgments, and ſins: So the <hi>Lords</hi> promiſe upon <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer runs,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 7 14</note>

                  <p n="3">3. Hypocriſie, word, or lip-devotion, without the power of piety (to wit, the true love and fear of God, and ſeeking after him) in the heart: Of the Hypocrite <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Job 27.9</note>

                  <p n="4">4. The propoſing of indirect, by, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ends in prayer: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe you ask amiſs, that you may conſume it upon your luſts:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 4.3</note> It is intolerable that holy and godly deſires (for the matter of them) ſhould travel to, and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with Heaven, to ſerve and bring in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for ſenſual or vile luſts.

                  <p n="5">5. A contentious, quarrelous, or malicious heart in prayer: Our bleſſed Saviour thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us for prayer; <hi>And when you ſtand pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

This default would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough it ſelf alone, both to keep back their prayers from them, and to bind on their ſins upon them: As <hi>two perſons cannot walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except they be agreed;</hi> ſo neither can their prayers aſcend up to Heaven together, except they be agreed: the one, at leaſt (and if both be from a ſtrife-enflamed Cenſer, what ever the matter be, both) muſt needs be ſhut out.

                  <p n="6">6. Infidelity, or weakneſs of Faith, or truſt in God: The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> requires us <hi>to ask in Faith, nothing wavering; for let not that man (that wavereth) think that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing of the Lord.</hi>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169943:148"/> perſons: It is long in the account and ſenſe of them that pray; but it is ſpeedy to the wicked, that are the ſubjects of that avenging. It is long, becauſe God waits for ſtrength of faith, as well as aſſiduity of cries in his Elect: it is ſpeedy, becauſe God is quicker in coming on in his work, then they are in their advance of faith: Though he bear long, yet he comes ſooner then their faith is ready; for <hi>when he cometh, he ſhall ſcarce find faith in the Earth.</hi>

This the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> renders as the reaſon of the accompliſhing of the ſeventy years captivity, and of the Lords hiding ſo long (in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) from his people and their prayers: <hi>All this evil is come upon us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9.13</note> 
                     <hi>yet made we not our prayers before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities.</hi> The people before, and all along during the captivity, did pray (as I have before noted) but they did not ſo pray, as withall to turn from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and <hi>therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil</hi> (ſaith he in the next words;)

We may note it in all experience, a courſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a courſe of ſin, cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I mean, they cannot both ſtand in force together, but either prayer will beat down ſin, or ſin will keep down and enervate prayer; neither do they ordinarily ſtand together (for any time) in regard of practice, but either prayer will break off the courſe of ſin, or ſin will break off the cuſtom of prayer. What the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſaith, <hi>of the Spirit and the fleſh,</hi> that <hi>they mutually luſt againſt one another,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17</note> the ſame may be ſaid of prayer and ſin, they combate and conflict each againſt other, and that until the one be brought down.</p>
                  <p>We have thus ſeen what ſins in ſpecial are cauſes of Gods hiding from prayers, and we have had them diſtinguiſhed in three ranks, namely, ſins againſt piety, ſins againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, and ſins in or about prayer: and under each of theſe have been muſtered up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particulars.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing propounded to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was certain circumſtances in ſin, which help forward this effect, and move God the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to it. Theſe are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Incorrigibleneſs in ſin, or a going on in ſin, notwithſtanding and in contradiction unto ſpecial means applyed for reformation; as,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169943:149"/> when the Word of the Lord is ſent out, and publiſhed unto a perſon, or people, for a direct conviction and rebuke of the ſin or ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and lived in, and for the calling of men to repentance of, and recovery from them; or, when the Judgments of God have come and lien upon men perſonally, domeſtically, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, in any kind, as a witneſs againſt, and correction for the ſin; or any other means hath been uſed; and yet, nevertheleſs, men perſiſt and obſtinately perſevere in their evil ways. This was <hi>Iſraels</hi> and <hi>Judahs</hi> aggravation of their ſin, and it added weight to, and furthered the Lords hiding from their prayers: <hi>But they refuſed to harken,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 7.11 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and pulled away the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſtopped their ears, that they ſhould not hear; yea, they made their hearts as an adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hoaſts hath ſent in his Spirit by the former Prophets: Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of Hoaſts: Therefore it came to paſs, that as he cryed, and they would not hear, ſo they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi> When the Lord declared to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.15.</note> by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> that <hi>he would go and return to his place,</hi> that is, that he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his preſence and audience to a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them; this was one thing which brought it on, They have done ſo and ſo,<note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> 
                     <hi>though I have been a rebuker of them all.</hi> And the ſame is alledged againſt that people, in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as concurring to this effect;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169943:150"/> 
                     <hi>I hid me,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo their froward and obſtinate running on in their ſin, was not the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but the antecedent, and reaſon why God was wroth, and, being angry, hid himſelf from them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Preſumption, or an adventuring to do an act, or run a courſe, againſt the expreſs and particular prohibition or warning of God by his Meſſengers againſt the doing thereof: As when <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs would needs go up to fight with the <hi>Amorites, Moſes</hi> relating it to them afterward, ſaith, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight,</hi>

So I ſpake unto you, and ye would not hear, but rebelled againſt the Commandment of the Lord, and went preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly up into the hill, &amp;c. and ye returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not harken to your voyce, nor give ear unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Scandalous ſinning. <hi>David,</hi> when the Lord had ſtruck the child that <hi>

                        <hi>David</hi> was not heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtood not with the rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a ſin, which made the enemies of God to blaſpheme ſhould not have an exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr <hi>Mede</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trib. part 2 pag. 298.</note>. Thoſe ſins of the people of God which do open the mouths of the profeſſed Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion to reproach the Name of God, are more then ordinarily obſtructive of prayer. It is time for God upon the remittance of ſuch by them to manifeſt his ſpecial diſ-favour in ſuch an effect, that ſo he may vindicate that Name of his which his people call upon from the aſperſion of their ſin. As God upon this ground refuſed to hear <hi>David,</hi> ſo did he, for the like cauſe, deny the petition of another (as eminent for nearneſs to, and favor with him, as he) to wit, <hi>Moſes:</hi> He beſought the Lord very pathetically for leave to go into, and ſee the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but the Lord would not harken unto him in it, but he muſt dye beyond <hi>Jordan;</hi> and what was the reaſon? the Lord tells it <hi>Aaron</hi> and him, <hi>Becauſe ye beleeved me not,</hi>

It is to be underſtood to have been, not for the peoples fault, but for his own ſin, which was an evil example, and a God-diſhonoring offence unto the people. In the days of the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi,</hi> and in his Prophecy, it appears there was
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169943:151"/> an ill ſucceſs of prayer (I have divers times mentioned it,) and this was one cauſe of it, <hi>the not hallowing duly the Name of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 2.2, 3 8, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>their contempt and vilifying of it;</hi> and, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the Prieſts and Levites are taxed therewith, the Lord ſaith unto them by name, <hi>If ye will not give glory unto my Name, I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi> Theſe bleſſings may ſignifie, either the bleſſings beſtowed on them by God, or the bleſsings or prayers which they offered up to God, and wherewith they bleſſed the people; or both (ſay the late Annotations:) the latter of the two ſenſes, as it aptly ſuiteth to the preſent purpoſe, ſo it is not incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the words and drift of them: The prayers of them that ſerve God, and in ſpecial of the Miniſters of his houſe, are blaſted for their ſcandalous ſins. In the very next words he ſaith, <hi>I will ſpread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your ſolemn Feaſts; and one (or it) ſhall take you away with it.</hi> The Lord will abhor them, and make them an abhorring and a ſhame unto men, that deſpiſe and detract the glory of his Name.

                     </note> he will caſt them out of his ſight, and cauſe them to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, like as the intrails and excrements of the beaſts that were killed for ſacrifices on thoſe days in the holy place were carried out of the Camp or City. <hi>It ſhal take them away to it,</hi> that is (as <hi>Druſius</hi> ſaith the Hebrew <hi>ſcholia</hi> expounds it) <hi>the contempt of my Name ſhall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169943:151"/> bring you to that contempt.</hi> A little further he ſaith to the ſame perſons, <hi>Ye are departed out of the way, ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law,</hi> (and in the ſequel) <hi>inſomuch that he</hi> (the Lord) <hi>regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.</hi> The errors of the Prieſts are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent cauſes (by way of pattern or patronage) of others, many others falls, and therefore may juſtly become cauſes of the non-acceptance of ſacrifices, and of the non-audience of prayers with God. To this I will add one example more, and it is ſtill of the ſame degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. What was the cauſe of thoſe diſmal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Eli</hi>'s time? that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>they fetched the Ark of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Lord out of Shiloh into their Camp,</hi> after their firſt defeat,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.2, &amp;c.</note> yet they received a ſecond, and greater, a total overthrow by the Philiſtins? The <hi>Ark of God</hi> ſaved them not; yea, it ſelf was taken, and in it <hi>the glory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Iſrael;</hi> the preſence of God was (in a ſence) removed from them: the cauſe was principally the ſins of thoſe that bare the <hi>Ark,</hi> the Prieſts, the two ſons of <hi>Eli;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lord had before, twice over, by two ſeveral Prophets, declared to <hi>Eli:</hi> And what were their ſins? Beſides the groſs nature of them, impious violation of the ſacrifices, and whoredom, this was their aggravation, <hi>through them men abhorred the offering of the Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.17, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>they made the Lords people to tranſgreſs:</hi> Their ſins were groſs and flagrant ſcandals and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:169943:152"/> ſtumbling blocks to the people, both to deter them from the worſhip of God by ſacrifices, and to draw them to commit the ſame crimes. I have the rather noted this way of ſinning, as prejudicial to the ſucceſs of prayer, becauſe our times and people abound with ſcandalous ſins, and that our <hi>Moſeſes</hi> and <hi>Davids,</hi> our Prieſts and Levites (I mean our Superiors and Leaders in Magiſtracy and Miniſtry) may be put in mind how pernicious the ſcandals of perſons of their rank are unto others, and how obſtructive of the prayers and votes put up unto God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sinning after prayer, and whileſt we are in expectance of our anſwer. This manner of ſinning is of a ſpecial malignity to hinder the taking effect of prayers, at leaſt for the time. When we have drawn as near to God as we can by any ſolemn and ſerious ſeeking unto him, and while we are wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ſeems to be the ſence of that caution ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Pſalmiſt, when he ſaid, <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace to his people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 85.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and to his Saints: But let them not turn again to folly.</hi> That cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>let them not turn again to folly,</hi> may as fitly be applyed to the time betwixt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

Thus it fared with <hi>Iſrael:</hi> They in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and under their yoke of bondage, cryed and groaned, and their cry came unto God, and God heard their groaning, and upon it he appeareth to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exo. 3 7, 8</note> telling him out of the buſh, <hi>I have heard their cry, and am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egytians, and to bring them up out of that Land, unto a good Land, and a large, unto a Land flowing with milk and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp;c.</hi> and accordingly the Lord did bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and even to the borders of <hi>Canaan</hi> preſently after: But when they ſhould have received the other part of their prayers and hopes, and of the Lords promiſes, to wit, poſſeſſion of that good Land,<note place="margin">Numb. 14 &amp; 26 64.</note> their ſin at <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſh,</hi> upon the return and report of the Spies concerning that Land, put betwixt them and it, and for the ſame the Lord had well-nigh ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſ-inherited them of it, and deſtroyed them with the peſtilence; but, however, they were ſo far pardoned, yet they were <hi>made to wander in the wilderneſs until forty years, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:169943:153"/> the lives of all the men that came out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, ſave Caleb and Joſhua, were expired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Such and ſo long an interruption was cauſed by the interpoſition of their ſin betwixt their prayers and the Lords performance, even when they were at the very brink thereof.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Apoſtatical ſinning, or ſinning by way of Apoſtacy, or falling off from God and his ways after an embracement of them.

Thus the Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zariah</hi> forewarned <hi>Aſa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.2</note> and his people: <hi>The Lord is with you while you be with him; and if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if you forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> And the ſame Item had <hi>David</hi> left with his ſon <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi>

Of all the ways of ſinning that are, this is one that doth (as it were) naturally, and by a kind of near proportion, procure this effect.

                  <head type="sub">Of the latter ſort of Cauſes of Gods hiding from Prayers.</head>
                  <p>WE have gone over the firſt ſort of Reaſons of the Lords hiding from his peoples prayers, and have therein ſeen what influence men on their part may have unto this effect, by way of demerit or provocation: the other ſort come now to be enquired into; thoſe are the final Cauſes, or the Ends which God propoſeth, deſigneth, and aimeth at in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>One End, <hi>viz.</hi> the puniſhment of ſin, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in all that which hath been ſaid already of the Cauſes given by men: for, if the ſins of men procure God to hide himſelf from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:169943:154"/> then the puniſhing of their ſin is one end aimed at by him in ſo doing. I ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here need to inſiſt on that.</p>
                  <p>But beſides, there are many other ends which God may have, and which his Word diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be ſet up by him in this proceeding; and thoſe are of another nature, to wit, merciful and gracious ends, or intentions of good and profit unto his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>God hath his gracious purpoſes, and is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in holding off from the prayers of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as well as in manifeſting himſelf upon them:<note place="margin">Jer. 29.11.</note> As in that of the Prophet, <hi>For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</hi> The words are uttered upon a <hi>ſuperſede as</hi> or ſtay of about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years put upon the hopes and prayers of thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> that were then captivated at <hi>Babylon:</hi> The Lord tells them he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and contrivances on foot directed to that very end which they themſelves deſired and expected, which was their peace and good; and he would not fail to bring that to paſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he poſted off their prayers (in regard of the direct purport of them, their preſent return to <hi>Judea</hi>) to ſo long a term; yea, he would effect that end of their prayers by not granting them; he would give them their expected end, though not by their expected means: they longed and waited to enjoy peace and welfare again at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but the Lord tells them they ſhould have thoſe benefits for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:169943:154"/> years at <hi>Babylon</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Ver. 5, 6, 7</note>; and then, after the expiration of that time, they ſhould re-enjoy the ſame at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">V. 10, 14</note>. God ſometimes ſeeth, that his, and his peoples aym will not be procured by letting them have their wills and prayers: the end therefore, which he finds will be unattained by his ſubſcribing to their Petitions, he projecteth to accompliſh by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing other ways: as the judicious Phyſician in ſome caſes diſcerns, that abſtinence is more conducible to his Patient, then either food or phyſick; ſo the wiſdom of God, upon ſome occaſions, judgeth it better for his Petitioners to keep them faſting (in reſpect of the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they deſire) then to ſend them away full-handed from his preſence.</p>
                  <p>The Lords hiding from his ſervants prayers may be (as to the purpoſe in hand) two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways: Firſt, By way of denyal of the thing asked. Secondly, By way of deferring it for a time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By denying: and when he doth thus, the queſtion here is, What may be his end herein? I anſwer, The intention and aym of God, in relation to the Suitors, is their profit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: 1. To prevent their harm. 2. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To prevent the harm that might enſue unto them, if thoſe deſires which he denyeth ſhould have been accompliſhed. The prayers of the ſervants of God, when they deſcend to particulars, as when they beg health, peace, victory, deliverance, proſperous ſucceſs in ſuch
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169943:155"/> a calling, undertaking, or condition, or the like, for themſelves or others; ſuch particulars (I ſay) though they think them deſirable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them for good, yet they may be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious and hurtful for them to have, as wine or ſweet-meats are for one in a Fever: God therefore, in denying them thoſe things, provideth for their indempnity. Of not a few of thoſe things, which our hearts are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed after, and our eyes are fixed upon in prayer, it may be ſaid to us, as it was by our Saviour to the two ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> and their mother, of their requeſt, <hi>Ye know not what ye ask.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20.22</note> We are like children, of vehement and impetuous deſires, but very unable in judgment either <hi>to refuſe the evil,</hi>

                     <hi>or chuſe the good:</hi> We are bent to ask <hi>a ſtone in ſtead of bread, a ſerpent in ſtead of a fiſh,</hi> for an <hi>egg, a ſcorpion:</hi> And certainly if our heavenly Father were as ready to give, as we are to ask ſome things, if he did not conſult our ſafety and profit more then we do our ſelves, and manifeſt his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſome while in withholding, as well as other-while in giving, we might periſh, or be very near undoing by our Petitions. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note>: The ſaying holds true, not only of the manner, <hi>as we ought,</hi> but
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169943:155"/> of the matter, <hi>what:</hi> and it holdeth univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of all matters; we are unskilled what to ask in all deſirable things whatſoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Spirit help us, and as an advocate in the Court, form our requeſts and pleas in and for us: Spirituals we cannot ſee at all, to deſire them; and temporals we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, ſo as to diſtinguiſh of them, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is convenient for us, and what is not. One of the wholeſomeſt Petitions that ever was put up to God, in relation to worldly Affairs, is that of our Saviour, praying to his Father for his Diſciples, <hi>that he would keep them from the evil of the world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 17.15</note> It is more neceſſary for us to be preſerved from the evil of the world, then to be gratified with the benefits of it in any kind whatſoever: and we, being ſubject to miſtake in our wiſhes about them, if we have a part in Chriſts prayer, we muſt needs be denyed in ſome of our own prayers concerning them: if God, according to it, deliver us from the evil of the world, he muſt needs deliver us from ſome of our ſuits about it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To promote their good: The Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of a thing prayed for may be, not only to put by a hurt that would come to his people by it, but to procure to them a benefit; it may be not only for their ſecurity, but for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; not only cautional, but gainful to them. It often cometh to paſs, that the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of a temporal benefit turneth to the ſpiritual good of them that ſought it; they
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:169943:156"/> miſs an outward comfort, and meet with an inward; and ſo are great gainers by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of their deſires. If men learn, by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of their Petition about ſome earthly concernment, to amend what is amiſs in their Souls, lives, or prayers; if they be drawn nearer to God, and more alienated from the things of this life, it proves well for them that they ſped not in the particular asked: they are no loſers by ſuch a miſcarrying. It is with the ſervants of God in this reſpect, as with Vines; let the branches of a Vine lance and ſprout forth while they will, and they will ſpread much, but bear little; the way to have them fruitful is to prune them: So, give a godly man all his requeſts, and he will be like an unlopped Vine, but ſlender and ſlow in ſpiritual growth and fruit; the way to make him fertile, and flouriſhing in grace, is to cut him ſhort of ſome of his deſires. I have mentioned before the Lords denyal of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Kadeſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 2.45</note> when they would have had the ſentence of the forty years wandering in the wilderneſs reverſed, and an inſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into <hi>Canaan</hi> granted: Now <hi>Moſes</hi> (after thoſe years were expired, and they were come again to the borders of <hi>Canaan</hi> to enter into it) looking back upon that many years travel, obſerves a multiplicity of good effects for which they had been kept, and led about by God ſo long in that wilderdeſs, to wit, <hi>to humble them, and to prove them, to know what was in their heart, whether they would
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:169943:156"/> keep Gods Commandments, or no; and to make them know,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 8.2.3, 15, 16. See alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5, 6</note> 
                     <hi>that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord; and that he might prove them, to do them good at their latter end.</hi> Thoſe ſervants of God, that are much and diligent in prayer, do, and ought, to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dayly for a multitude of things, both in relation to themſelves and others: and in this variety of matters prayed for, although there be a fair conſiſtibility in the asking of them, yet there may be an inconſiſtency in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: there may be a ſimulty of deſire, there cannot be a ſimulty of fruition: for though there be no intrinſecal contrariety, yet there may be an accidental oppoſition amongſt them: In this caſe therefore, where we cannot have all our requeſts fulfilled, if the Lord chuſe out and prefer thoſe that are the more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and needful; if he put back ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he may make way for greater; if he ſet aſide meaner Petitions, that he may reſerve place for weightier; the accounts of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being caſt up together, we ſhall ſuſtain no prejudice; but, on the other hand, reap much advantage by denyal in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other way of the Lords hiding from his peoples prayers, is in deferring or delaying them for a time: This way being more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with God towords his faithfulleſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then the other of that denyal, I ſhall be ſomething more large and particular in noting
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169943:157"/> out the ſeveral ends of it: They may be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. In relation to the perſons praying: 2. Or reſpecting others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ends in reſpect of the parties pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as we learn them out of Scripture) may be theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reference to their prayers, to better them therein; to ſtir them up, and ſet them on to pray, with both more frequency and more fervency: to excite them to a further meaſure, both of aſſiduity and ardency in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. God will have us, not only to ask (when the matter is of moment) but to ask again and again; to pray, and that with much inſtancy and vehemency: this may be the meaning of our Saviours trebling of the precept, <hi>Ask, ſeek,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 7.7.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; knock:</hi> importing both a multiplication of the act, and an heightening in the activity and intention of the mind therein: Seeking implyeth more earneſtneſs and intenſneſs then asking; and knocking more importunacy then ſeeking. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Evening, morning, and at noon,</hi>

                     <hi>There appeared a woman clothed with the Sun, &amp;c. and ſhe, being with child, cryed, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in birth, and pained to be delivered.</hi> This is underſtood of the Churches laboring in prayer to obtain of God a <hi>Chriſtian Emperor,</hi> which might ceaſe their perſecutions, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Chriſtian Religion. Now in Nature a woman that brings forth a child doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive it, but ripen it certain moneths in her womb, and when ſhe hath gone her full time, ſhe muſt undergo ſharp labour, and bitter birth-pains, ere ſhe embrace her child: In like manner, that our prayers may bring forth the man-child begged, there muſt be not only a firſt conception, but a dayly forming and an increaſing of them, and a proſecuting them to the full time, and a ſuſtaining the burden and ſorrows of their maturation and bringing forth.</p>
                  <p>Again, The prayers of the Saints are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>golden viols full of odours:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5.8.</note> They muſt not only be for their quality <hi>odours,</hi> or incenſe, that is, pure, fragrant, and delightſom unto God; but for the quantity they muſt be <hi>viols full:</hi> as we read elſewhere of a <hi>bottle
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169943:159"/> for the tears</hi> of Gods ſervants, ſo here we have <hi>viols</hi> for their prayers: and they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtay for the return of their prayers, and to renew them until they have filled up theſe <hi>viols</hi> with them: when theſe are full, then the <hi>Lamb openeth the ſeven ſeals,</hi> then doth God manifeſt himſelf in his Providences anſwerable to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Trap</hi> on Gen. 25.21.</note>I will but add this: Prayer is reſembled to thoſe arrows which <hi>Eliſha, lying ſick on his death-bed,</hi> ordered <hi>King Joaſh to take, and with them to ſmite upon the ground:</hi> As the blows given with them, ſo the uſe of prayer, muſt be often reiterated, that the mercy may be throughly obtained: we muſt repeat and renew it, and that often enough; if we do it not to the full count, we may impe our ſelves in the benefit ſought of God.</p>

                     </gap>, that is, we muſt not only continue our prayers, and multiply them in number, but reinforce them; we muſt renew and intend our inſtancy and vigor in them. For this purpoſe prayer is called an agony, ſtrife, or combate: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſires the Romans <hi>to ſtrive together with him in their prayers to God for him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ro. 15.30.</note> Now they that undertook thoſe exerciſes in the Grecian games, to which the phraſe alludeth, it did not ſuffice them to hold out the time, and keep up the action, but they were to put to their utmoſt ſtrength, and follow it with might and main, that they might overcome, and get the Crown. So the Lord would have
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169943:159"/> us to do in prayer. This is the meaning of that Parable, of one <hi>friends</hi> coming to another <hi>at midnight to borrow of him three leaves;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 11.5, &amp;c.</note> which motion the friend requeſted at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelf from, as <hi>having his doors ſhut, and being in bed with his children, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed then to riſe;</hi> but, being further preſſed with importunity, he cannot but grant it. The reddition hereof is, the near relation and dear affection which a ſervant of God ſtandeth in with God, is the foundation of Gods reſpect unto him in prayer; but in many ſpecial caſes the Lord will have ſuper-added thereunto a begging importunacy, ere his prayer can be followed with the effect of audience.</p>
                  <p>If we will with <hi>Jacob</hi> be Princes, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers with God, we muſt be Wreſtlers with him in prayer. <hi>Jacob,</hi> when terrified with the tydings of his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies coming to meet him, not only prayed, as he did immediately upon the news, but after he had diſpoſed of his bands, and ſent out his preſent to his brother, and taken up his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lord called him forth (as it were) to a combate all that night with his Angel; and had not he not only held out all the time until break of day, but by a power from God (as it were) overcome God, whileſt he held the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel faſt, and would not ſuffer him to go until he bleſſed him, he might have miſſed the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some of the Ancients conceive, that in that conflict there were two, beſides <hi>Jacob,</hi> that wreſtled; one againſt him, another on his

                     </note>: but certain it is, there was a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſtrength, and more then humane, in, or with <hi>Iacob,</hi> elſe he had never been <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Prince with God. Indeed the power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency which he had was but precarious, or borrowed of him with whom, either perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or by way of repreſentation, he wreſtled: it pleaſed God, whoſe is all power, for that time to put forth the more might in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the leſs in the Angel: but, however, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though it was but lent, it was a power that denominated him a Prince with God. Some obſerve the word, <hi>wreſtled,</hi> in the text, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an action that raiſeth duſt, and cauſeth ſweat<note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and Mr <hi>Trap</hi> in loc.

Jacob</hi> did not maintain the combate, or carry away the victory by the ſtrength of his body, but by the force of his tears and entreaties: it was not the might of his arms and limbs which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but his paſſionate, humble, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate begging for the bleſſing which melted the Angel. There is a main ſtrength in prayers and tears, when they are poured out in due ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> telleth us of <hi>ſtrong crying and tears;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the deſign and drift of God is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169943:160"/> to bring his people to a certain meaſure and pitch in prayer, both in regard of frequency and fervency; and this is the reaſon why he defers their prayers: his putting in delays is one means of drawing them on to that length and proportion which he aimeth at to be therein: Such dilatory hidings of God are like a ſmall quantity of water ſprinkled on fire, which makes it burn the hotter; or like abſtinence to a dull and cloyed ſtomack, which helps to whet and ſharpen it to its food. The Lord carries himſelf to us, as a man that hears his friend call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him afar off, and ſeems as if he heard him not, that he may make him come nearer, and ſpeak his mind more diſtinctly and fully to him: So the Lord ſometimes ſhews as if he did not hear, would not grant our petitions, that he may cauſe us to draw nearer to him, and to open and proſecute our requeſts more amply and affectionately. When <hi>Peter</hi> was caſt into priſon, and deſigned unto death by <hi>Herod</hi> the King, God intended to deliver him, and could have done it at his firſt ſtretching forth his hand againſt him, or upon the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which the Church made for him; but he deferred it till the night which <hi>Herod</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be his laſt night, that the Churches prayer might be made <hi>without ceaſing unto God for him;</hi> that it might be <gap reason="foreign">

This is the firſt End of Gods hiding from his peoples prayers by delay, to wit, to increaſe and make up that fervor and frequency in prayer which he will have to forego the accompliſhment of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Now the deſign of God, in the delaying the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their prayers, is to mould them to this fittedneſs: his work is, not only to bring about a mercy to them, but to bring them to it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſuitable frame for it: he not only <hi>cauſeth his ear to hear, but prepareth their heart,</hi> as in that of the Pſalmiſt, the which ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as well of preparing their heart to receive the thing prayed for, as to pray for it<note n="†" place="margin">Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Prayer. c. 7. ſec. 3.</note>. <hi>We are put to pray</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr) not that we may alter God, which were in vain for us to to eſſay, ſeeing he is immutable, but rather that we our ſelves may be altered; for by prayers we are made capable of the bleſſings of God</hi>

He relateth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. that upon the firſt viſion or voyce of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, <hi>there remained no ſtrength in him; his comelineſs was turned in him into corruption, and he was in a deep ſleep upon his face, and his face towards the ground,</hi> verſ. 8, 9. Then, after that, <hi>he ſtood,</hi> indeed, but <hi>trembling,</hi> verſ. 11. Neither was that all; for after this it's ſaid, <hi>he became dumb,</hi> verſ. 15. And theſe his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were not removed in one inſtant, but by ſucceſſive degrees: Firſt, <hi>an hand touched him
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169943:162"/> which ſet him upon his knees, and upon the palms of his hands,</hi> verſ. 10. Next of all, he is animated by the Angel againſt his trembling, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14. After that, <hi>his lips are touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his mouth opened,</hi> verſ. 16. And, laſt of all, <hi>he is ſtrengthened,</hi> verſ. 18. And after all theſe corroborations, when he was thus brought into a capacity, the Angel delivers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his meſſage, as the return of his prayers. There is in him a notable emblem of the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ineptitude which is in us to entertain what by our prayers we would obtain; and of our progreſſive or gradual coming on to a power of reception: One while we are too feeble to brook the glory of God, which is to break forth in the mercy; another while we are too drowzy and ſenſleſs to hear or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his anſwer to us; or we are ſo fearful and wavering, that we cannot take faſt hold on the benefit, if reached out to us; or we are ſo dumb, that we know not how to expreſs due thanks unto God for the deſired bleſſing, were it beſtowed on us: and we are long ere we can get over all theſe incapacities. So that, what the Apoſtle ſaith unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by way of reaſon, for his not feeding them with meat (that is, with more deep and ſpiritual doctrine) the ſame may be rendered to us, as the reaſon of our not ſooner embracing the effect of our prayer,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Hitherto you were not able to bear it, neither yet are you able.</hi> It is well worth our obſerving unto this purpoſe, what a number of interpoſals, and of what weight and difficulty

The preparatives are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There muſt be a great, a bitter, a ſolemn, and an univerſal mourning of thoſe, in whom the ſpirit of prayer is poured forth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a mourning like that of a tender Parent for his firſt-born or only ſon, and like that of a deſolate Nation for a moſt pious and hopeful Prince, ſuch a one as was <hi>Joſiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is to be unto them a revelation and application of the free, full, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Expiatory of the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1. The Lord having poured out the Spirit of ſupplication upon them, and they by it pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their Souls, as well in bitter mourning for their woundings and crucifyings of Chriſt, as in earneſt petitions for their reconciliation,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169943:163"/> the purifying fountain of Chriſts blood muſt be poured out upon their conſciences unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There muſt be an abolition of Idols and falſe worſhip, and an extirpation of uncalled and lying Prophets, and of corrupt Teachers and Doctrines out of the Land, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And let us note by the way, that the abolition of theſe muſt be, not only by the hand of God, <hi>I will cut off, &amp;c.</hi> but by men, even by the proſecution of the parents and neareſt friends of the counterfeit Prophet: and that ſuch muſt be expelled, not only out of the houſe of God by Church-cenſures, but out of <hi>the Land,</hi> or civil Liberty and Society, by corporal penalties: and that lying Prophets, not only in regard of matter, but in reſpect of miſſion, to wit, that make themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when they have no lawful call unto it, muſt be thus delt with: read <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There muſt be a very ſharp and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecution ſtirred up againſt the people of God and his true Prophets or Paſtors, which ſhall prove to the major part of them as a <hi>ſword</hi> to diſperſe and deſtroy them, and to the reſidue as a refiners furnace, to try, purifie, and prepare them: <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Theſe four things will the Lord have wrought in his people after that he hath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the ſpirit of ſupplications upon them, and before they receive the effect of their prayers made thereby. Theſe are the neceſſary
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:169943:163"/> Harbingers of, or prediſpoſitions to that iſſue: There muſt be a deep humiliation for ſins, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious expiation of ſins, an effectual extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all falſe ways of Religion, and a through tryal and purgation of them that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the true: and when theſe things are compaſſed, then cometh in the return of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>They ſhall call on my Name, and I will hear them, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>And agreeable hereunto is there a paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> chap. 3. the Lord in that place puts his people to a ſtay; <hi>Therefore wait upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the day that I riſe up to the prey,</hi> verſ. 8.

The qualifications are thoſe that lie in that Text, betwixt <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, and 14. Let us take the particulars out, becauſe they are very material: They, or the principal of them, are theſe four:</p>

                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:169943:164"/>1.

                  <p n="2">2. A general union in Religion: <hi>That they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> verſ. 9. There muſt be neither neutral Atheiſm, nor unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly ſeparation, or diverſity in divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sole confidence in God; and, as a means thereof, ſtripping off all their former outward glory, proſperity, and wealth: <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of the midſt of thee them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy pride, and thou ſhalt no more be haughty becauſe of my holy mountain: I will alſo leave in thee an afflicted and poor people; and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord,</hi> verſ. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fidelity and truth in deed and word: <hi>The remnant of Iſrael ſhall not do ini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quity, nor ſpeak lyes; neither ſhall a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful tongue be found in their mouth:</hi> verſ. 13.</p>
                  <p>Theſe gracious diſpoſitions the Lord will have introduced, or renewed in his people calling upon his Name, as ſuitable to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run and uſher in the benefits promiſed in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169943:164"/> the reſidue of that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe four things in <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> and the other four noted out of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> be well conſidered, as the pre-requiſites which the Lord deſigneth to find or frame in his praying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and which he annexeth to the promiſe of audience (eſpecially in things of grand impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) as neceſſary antecedents to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. I might amplifie and parallel theſe by other places of Scripture, but the clear and cloſe delivery of them in theſe two places ſhall ſuffice. Let our mediation upon them be this: Until we be thus diſpoſed and faſhioned in ſome convenient meaſure, we are not fit to have the great and excellent things which we proſecute by prayer; and all the delay of our prayers which we ſorrowfully lie under is but needful, as the ſpace of time which is allotted for the acquiring of thoſe diſpoſitions: and how long ſoever the delays ſeem to be, it is our ſlow coming on in theſe graces which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the length thereof unto what it is.</p>

Another end may be the exerciſe and tryal of the people of God that pray: As the Lord, by deferring their prayers for ſome time, may intend the producing or bettering thoſe graces which are deficient in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fitting of them for the receipt of their anſwer; ſo he may aym at the exerciſe and probation of ſuch graces as are already ſeated in them; for the which exerciſe and probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the withholding of their prayers may be a fit opportunity and means. There are ſome
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169943:165"/> virtues or fruits of the Spirit, the chief uſe and experiment whereof appears in deſertions and over-cloudings: As the principal ſervice of Tapers is to give us light when the place we are in is covered with darkneſs; or, as the worth and ſoveraign vertue of ſome precious cordials is ſhewn in a ſwoon or trance; ſo is the truth and excellency of ſome graces beſt atteſted by the abſence (for a time) of thoſe enjoyments and comforts which are ſought and waited for. Such a caſe diſcovers what mettal the vertues we profeſs are made of, and what indeed they can do: By this means is faith, patience, love, and ſincerity ſet a work, and proved in us to the purpoſe: <hi>Here is the faith and patience of the Saints.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 13.10 14.12</note> And again, <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jeſus:</hi> that is, here they come to action, proof, and manifeſtation in their faith, patience, and ſincerity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; namely, where and while Gods wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes prophecy in ſackcloth: his Saints are captived, and killed under the tyranny of the cruel beaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> faith and courage were then evidenced, when in the tempeſt at Sea neither Sun nor Star in many days appeared,<note place="margin">Act. 27.10</note> and all hope of being ſaved was taken away. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs</hi> confidence in God was then put to it and tryed, when, being ſhut up in a double grave, <hi>viz.</hi> the belly of the Whale, and the bowels of the Sea, he nevertheleſs ſaid unto

                     <hi>Jobs</hi> truſt in God was then raiſed to the height of action and manifeſtation, when in his deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate he reſolved, <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 2.3, 4</note> The <hi>juſt then lives by his faith</hi> indeed, when <hi>the viſion of the fulfilling of his prayers and the divine promiſes tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> The patience of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and of the faithful perſonated by him, appeareth where he ſaith, <hi>I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob,</hi>

                     <hi>and I will look for him.</hi> It was a full proof of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſincerity when Satan could not move him from his integrity, neither by all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which he brought upon him from without, nor by all the miſts and temptations which he caſt upon his ſpirit. So were the people of God tryed,<note place="margin">Pſa. 44 17 &amp;c.</note> when <hi>the Lord had ſore broken them in the place of Dragons, and covered them with the ſhadow of death:</hi> When <hi>the Lord</hi> (as to their ſenſe) <hi>was aſleep, caſt them off, and hid his face, forgetting their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and their oppreſſion; and yet then they did not forget him, neither deal falſly in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: their heart did not turn barck, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their ſteps decline from his way.</hi> The love and compaſſion of the ſervants of God is ſeen, when <hi>Sion ſitteth watching, ſolitary and deſolate;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 102.14 &amp;c. 137.1, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>and they then take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favor the duſt thereof:</hi> and when <hi>they ſit down by the rivers of Babylon, and weep at the remembrance of Sion; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:169943:166"/> not to forget Jeruſalem, but to remember her before their chief joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such graces as theſe the Saints of God have given them, not only for ornament and beauty, but for uſe and ſervice; and that not for eaſie and ordinary employment only, but for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and diſtreſſes: They are their armor, wherewith to fortifie and fence themſelves in the evil day; and in ſuch a day their skill and ſtrength in the uſe of them is proved. <hi>Job</hi> in his ſtate of deſertion ſaith, <hi>He hideth himſelf that I cannot ſee him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 23.10</note> 
                     <hi>but he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth as gold: q. d.</hi> Though he hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from me, I am not hid from him; though I ſee not him, he takes exact notice of me: he ſtands by me as a Founder doth by his mettal in the furnace, and obſerves me; he continues me in this eſtate, but as a Goldſmith doth keep his gold in the fire; that is, for probation ſake: and as ſoon as he hath ſufficiently tryed me, he will remove me out of the furnace; and then ſet as great a price and luſtre upon me as the Goldſmith doth on his gold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The end of the Lords temporary hiding himſelf from his people may be for his fuller manifeſting of himſelf unto them: as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> ſaid of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſickneſs,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.4</note> 
                     <hi>This ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby:</hi> So may we here; this hiding is not unto our loſs of God, but for his clearer ſhining forth unto us. It may make for Gods fuller mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:169943:166"/> of himſelf: 1. During the <hi>interim</hi> or ſpace of delay. 2. Afterward, or in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By means of this deferring, and even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, the Lord may the more appear, and communicate himſelf unto his people: he, by hiding himſelf in one reſpect, may the more impart himſelf unto them another way. God would not grant the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jehojakims</hi> and <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> captivities (among whom were <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi>

                     <hi>whom I have ſent out of this place into the Land of the Caldeans for their good; for I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good.</hi> God will own them one way, though he deny them another way: he will eye them in one kind, though he hide his face from them in another kind: yea, he will own and eye them in that way and kind that ſhall be moſt for their weal and good. Of them
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169943:167"/> the Lord ſaith in another Prophet, (when as their <hi>brethren</hi> that were left at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſeemed to ſcorn them as out-caſts, ſaying to them, <hi>Get you far from the Lord, unto us is the Land given in poſſeſſion,) Although I have caſt them far off among the Heathen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eze. 11.16</note> 
                     <hi>and although I have ſcattered them among the Countries, yet will I be to them as a little Sanctuary in the Countries where they ſhall come.</hi> Thus the Lord recompenceth their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prival of their formerly poſſeſſed, and now much longed for priviledges: Though he caſt them out from their own habitations in <hi>Judea,</hi> and from his houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet he doth not caſt them off from himſelf; they ſhall have his preſence, protection, and proviſion, in all the Countries where they are ſtrangers and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: They change indeed their own Land for other Countries, and the company of their Brethren for the vicinity of Heathens; but they change not their God. They may not carry along with them the material Sanctuary which they had, nor rear up a new one where they are; but, which is better, (for it is the preheminence of the Church in the new and heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 21.22</note>) the Lord himſelf will be their Temple: And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>a little Sanctuary,</hi> this is no diminution of their priviledg; <hi>little</hi> may mean the commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peculiarity of the Sanctuary, or the proportion of it to their ſmall number; but others more probably read it, <hi>a Sanctuary for a little,</hi> that is, <hi>for a little time,</hi> to wit, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169943:167"/> their ſeventy years abode there. Thus the Lord makes them ſavers, yea great gainers, in their ſtay at <hi>Babylon.</hi> They would fain have been at Gods Sanctuary in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that they may not; but (which was incomparably better, then eſpecially) God himſelf would be their Sanctuary. They deſired a periſhable Sanctuary, and which indeed ſhortly after was burnt down to the ground; but the Lord would become a Sanctuary to them not made with hands, and of everlaſting ſtrengh. The Lord had already forſaken that Sanctuary in <hi>Iudea</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 12.7</note>, ſo that if they had had their wiſh, they had had a Sanctuary without God; but the Lord provides far better for them in that they ſhall have God for their Sanctuary. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, galled and buffeted with the thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan,</hi> beſought the Lord again and again, that it might depart from him: This his trebled ſuit might not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for an inſtant removal, but in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>My grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.8, 9</note> with which he was ſo well apayd, that he ſaith, <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me:</hi> The word here rendered, <hi>to reſt,</hi> ſignifies to cover, or compaſs about, as doth a <hi>Tent</hi> or <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> them that are within it: the ſence then of the Apoſtle there, is, although Satan be ſuffered to continue his aſſailant, yet the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt ſhall be a ſhelter unto him on every ſide, as a Tent is to a man againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:169943:168"/> of Sun and weather. Thus the Apoſtle, by the deferring of his requeſt, had a greater experiment of the grace and power of Chriſt within him; for whereas, if he had gained his Petition, he had but purchaſed his quiet; now, being relieved this way, he hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>moſt gladly rather to glory.</hi>

                  <p>I Am now to ſpeak to the Hypotheſis, or the Caſe in particular, as it is ours: <hi>What may be the reaſon of the Lords hiding himſelf now from his people of theſe Nations in respect of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:169943:181"/> their prayers?</hi> Of this I muſt ſay ſomething, but it ſhall be but by way of hint; for I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need to ſpeak of this all that I could, nor can I ſpeak all that there is in it: The former I need not, the reſolution of this query being ſomeway contained in what hath been already ſaid in anſwer to the query in general; the latter I cannot, by reaſon of the large bredth of the Subject, it extending it ſelf to ſo wide a circuit of ground, to ſo great a multitude of perſons, and to ſo vaſt a mixture and variety of ways and tranſactions, and thoſe ſo ſecret or intricate, that neither mine, nor any other one mans experience or eye-ſight, is able to ken or overlook the whole. In ſhort, unto a full and perfect diſcovery of the reaſon (I mean not of what is hidden in Gods councel, but of that matter of reaſon which is extant and enquira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by means afforded to us) of this effect in our Caſe, there muſt go theſe three things. 1. An exact knowledg and remembrance of the whole Oracle of God, at leaſt ſo much of his Word as delivers us any rule or light in this matter. 2. A perfect underſtanding of the ſpiritual condition, of the ways, and of the prayers of all the perſons that have any either influence or concernment in this effect. 3. A faculty of diſcourſe or deduction which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring or certain, both by way of application of the Rule to the ſubject, and of inference of the concluſion thereupon. So much as any is deficient in any of theſe (as who is not in every of them?) ſo far he ſhall come ſhort of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:169943:182"/> and abſolute reſolution of this queſtion. Now if I ſhould ſay, ſome kind of certitude in the point of Application and Inference is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, yet it muſt be acknowledged very rare and difficult in this imperfect ſtate of man on Earth, and in theſe byaſſing and partial times. But for a perfection in the two former, who can in this world once pretend to it?</p>
                  <p>Yet muſt not the Queſtion therefore be wholly layd aſide: For, 1. Though an exact knowledg and comprehenſion of the Rule of Scripture be not to be acquired, yet ſome good and ſerviceable meaſure thereof is acquirable; and though the full ſtate of mens hearts, ways, and prayers be not humanely fathomable, yet there is much matter of fact obvious unto thoſe that will obſerve, as to many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which do moſt concern us: to lay to heart a curious ſearch, a critical Judgment, <hi>Joſephs</hi> divining cup, or his divining for his cup, needs not; they are plain enough to be ſeen; we have not ſo much need to be new informed, as to be put in mind of them; and the work is not ſo much to bring them within our ſight, as to preſs them upon our hearts. 2. As it moſt nearly concerns us, ſo it may much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage us, to diſcover what we can in this query, though we cannot be ſo abſolute and exact in our ſolution of it: for we ſhall never ſeek remedy, either by the removal of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cauſes, or by endeavoring after the Ends of this hiding of God from us, until we be ſomewhat reſolved herein; and ſo far as
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:169943:182"/> we gain any diſcovery and ſatisfaction about it, ſo far we are in an advance towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying of it. 3. If we be diligent to find out what we can, and to practice according to what we find, we then may hope God will both accept and meet us in the diſcovery we endevor, and promote us both in it, and in our recovery out of that evil which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it: Although there may be divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in men moving God to this deportment toward his people, which we can never ſearch out, yet the invincible ignorance of them ſhall not prejudice us. God impoſeth not upon us to find out what is inextricably hid, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and own what is occurrent to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and to rectifie what is ſo deſired. If each man would buſie himſelf about this, and we would all communicate each to other, and borrow one of another our ſeveral apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; though one can ſay but a little, yet all together might (by the help of divine grace) ſearch out and bring in much towards the making up of a ſufficient anſwer to this.</p>
                  <p>That which I apprehend, and will here ſay of it, ſhall be contained under theſe three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: 1. It is more then probable that of all thoſe cauſes of the Lords hiding himſelf from his peoples prayers above collected, not one, or ſome few only, but many, if not all, have ſome place, cauſality, or efficacy in the preſent caſe. 2. That plurality of reaſons, which there may be of this thing among us, we cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſe aſcribable wholly to every one,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:169943:183"/> or to any one perſon or party, but we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them to the whole community diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively, or diſperſedly; ſo as that ſome of them more properly belong to one, ſome to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and all to the whole, by way of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. 3. Although many, moſt, or all the recited cauſes may have influence in the preſent caſe, yet ſome of them may be conceived more predominant, and more notable in the effect, then the reſt, and therefore more neceſſary for us to obſerve and lay to heart. Somewhat of each of theſe in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is more then probable, that of all the reaſons of the Lords hiding himſelf from his peoples prayers above enumerated, a multitude of them, if not the moſt, or all, have ſome place, cauſality, and efficacy in this effect now among us; I mean, of all of both thoſe ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> whether meritorious or procuring on mans part, or final and intentional on Gods part: All the cauſes of both theſe kinds, or many of each of them, may now have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the producing of this ſad effect: Our caſe ſeems to yield much matter of reaſon in both theſe reſpects; many and mighty provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in us, great and various deſignments of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the matter of provocation on our part, we need not look far, or ask for which of thoſe ſins before rehearſed it is that the Lord deals thus with us: there is ſuch ſtore of them among us, that we may ask, which of them is not found in us, and that in an high
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:169943:183"/> degree? and therefore, which of them is it not for? We can ſcarce tell how to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of them, to ſay, it is for this or that, more then the other, they are all ſo rife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: As the Lord tells his people of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, I have wounded thee with the wound of an Enemy,</hi>

So may it be ſaid of us; why hath the Lord in ſo many and great things, and for ſo long, hid his face, and turned a deaf ear to his peoples prayers and cries? why it is for the whole maſs and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and high encreaſe of our iniquities; it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:169943:184"/> is <hi>for all our ſins, even in all our borders:</hi> Theſe put all together, prove more in number, heavier in weight, and louder in cry, then our prayers.</p>
                  <p>When the ſtate of <hi>Iudah</hi> was grown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly and incorrigibly corrupt, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining judgments of God were in pouring forth irrevocably upon them, that is, ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ieconiahs</hi> captivity, and a little before the laſt of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> certain of the Elders of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> came to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to enquire of the Lord by him, the Lord wills him to give them this anſwer,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.1, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I will not be enquired of by you:</hi> and further, in ſtead of the Prophets ſupplicating to him for them, he directs him to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them by way of charge, and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them of thoſe their and their forefathers ſins, that had made him ſo inexorable towards them: <hi>Wilt thou plead for them, ſon of man? wilt thou plead for them? cauſe them to know the abominations of their fathers:</hi> And again, <hi>Wilt thou plead for,</hi>

                     <hi>wilt thou plead for the bloody City? yea, thou ſhalt ſhew her all her abominations:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">cha. 23.36</note> And once again, <hi>Wilt thou plead for Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations.</hi> As face anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth face, ſo doth (methinks) <hi>Englands</hi> preſent condition anſwer that of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and that in reſpect both of ſins and divine wrath: The time of calamity, the time that iniquity hath an end, ſeemeth to be now upon us: we are (as it were) betwixt <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:169943:184"/> 
                     <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> captivities; betwixt over-paſſed, and new-ariſing and imminent miſchiefs and ruines: and theſe Scriptures ſeem to make the very ſame return to our former and preſent ſeekings unto God, as it doth directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to them. We plead with God for <hi>England,</hi> but there are other pleaders before him againſt her, to wit, her abominations. We plead by way of interceſſion for her, theſe plead by way of accuſation and out-cry againſt her: We plead for her help and deliverance, theſe plead for her puniſhment and deſtruction. The plea of theſe is more equal, more moving, and powerful, then that of ours; eſpecially when as both are ours; when we that pray are the authors of thoſe abominations: The cry of ſins is then more eſpecially prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prayers, when not only ſins are great and many, but they are theirs that pray. I call them ours that pray, as being ſo, either by the committing, or by contracting the guilt of them; either by the acting or by the acceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. Two ways I find ſin becomes National, or imputed univerſally to all: 1. When the moſt or the generality of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perpetrate it; as in many of thoſe charges upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> in the Prophets before the captivity. 2. When one or a few commit a ſin, and the reſt (joyned in the ſame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or body politique, and (it may be) in one common oath, or covenant, binding out from that ſin,) let it paſs, neglecting their duty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the preventing or expiating of it: as
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:169943:185"/> in the caſe of <hi>Achan,</hi> and in divers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs in the Prophets; and particularly in one of the places even now cited<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 22</note>. The ſins of many ſpecial parties in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as of Princes, Prieſts, Prophets, Children againſt their Parents, and the particular ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her, are called <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Here then is the matter: we have put up prayers, or entered our pleas before God for <hi>England,</hi> but our ſuit is not heard, or brought to iſſue: and that which cauſeth the demur, is, our abominations come in, and lye, yea cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: This perhaps is acknowledged in the general; but what are the particulars of our ſins? and who will for their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars own and take to theſe abominations, and ſay, this or that have I done? For the latter, I will only ſay this, Whoſoever he be that will not take to his own ſin, now it riſeth up in judgment againſt the Land, and the joynt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made for the ſame, he is worſe then <hi>Achan:</hi> and if he will not own his ſin, <hi>be ſure his ſin will own,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb 32 23</note> 
                     <hi>or find him out.</hi> For the former, what are the ſins of <hi>England</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that now interrupt the prayers that have gone, and are dayly going up for her? I anſwer, What ſin is there found in all the Bible to be obſtructive of National Prayer, that is not rife and ripe in <hi>England?</hi> Here is abominable Idolatry, Covenant-breaking with or in the matters of God, abuſe of Religion to carnal ends, ſloth and declining in Gods ſervice, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:169943:185"/> and rejection of the Word of God, and carnal confidence. Again, for ſins againſt the ſecond Table, here is blood-guiltineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, unmercifulneſs, covetouſneſs, and pride in their height. Again, for ſins cleaving unto prayers, we pray, but ſin is choked, and lies hid; the heard is unhumbled, devotion is formal and counterfeit, indirect ayms are ſet up, contentions and breaches of charity are reſerved and carryed on, faith faileth or ſhrinks up, and ſin is unreformed. Laſtly, for the modal aggravations, the ſins of <hi>England</hi> are heightened by grievous incorrigibility, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, ſcandalouſneſs, repetition after prayer, and apoſtacy after beginnings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>To purſue all theſe ſeverally, and as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (with all the other ſins of the Nation that are mighty to pull down, continue, and increaſe the judgments of God, and to hinder prayers) would amount to a volume, or roll as large as that in <hi>Zechariah,</hi> of many cubits in length and bredth: and to charge them fully home, would require a reprover as ſharp, flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and undaunted, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who was <hi>a man of ſtrife,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.28</note> I will but point at ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>Here is Idolatry: indeed it is not yet as in the Heathen, or as in ſome Chriſtian Nations, or as it hath been in the former ages generally practiſed &amp; authorized; but it hath a being, and (which is a ſhame, yea a horrible thing to ſay or hear, after ſo long ejection of it, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the clear light and true worſhip, and ſo ſtrong tyes and oaths upon us againſt it,) a reviving of late among us: There are thoſe <hi>whoſe eyes begin to be after their fathers Idols:</hi> There are that <hi>begin to enquire, ſaying, How did the Nation</hi> (of old) <hi>ſerve their gods?</hi> or, why may not we, or they that liſt, do ſo likewiſe? And how general is, if not the committance, yet the contagion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when as ſome practiſe it, others plead for its freedom, others argue for it as no Idolatry, others connive at it, and let it alone, and others work underhand for its further impunity? That which the Prophet utters, by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and reproof, of the impiety of the Heathen Nations,<note place="margin">Micah 4.5</note> 
                     <hi>All people will walk, every one in the name of his God,</hi> is now owned and voted for by many, and they ſay, <hi>Let all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (or they ſhould) <hi>walk every one in the name of his god:</hi> and further, beſides the groſs or corporal ſort of Idol-worſhip, or adoring either Images, the work of mens hands, or Creatures, the work of Gods hands; there are two other kinds of Idolatry, and they are both
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:169943:186"/> among us. There is the Idolatry of the brain, and the Idolatry of the heart: The Idolatry of the brain, to wit, the entertaining of Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical notions or conceits of God, or the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of ſuch figments in the underſtanding, of God, as are directly oppoſite to that divine Nature and Perſonality, or diſtinction of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, as is revealed unto us in the Word of God, to be the object of our faith and worſhip. And the Idolatry of the heart, that is, Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; for this ſin the Apoſtle brandeth for Idolatry<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 3 5.

We have multiplyed Oaths, and ſtudied for the moſt ſolemn, expreſs and ſtrict forms of declaring and binding our ſelves; as if we would conſtrain both God and all the world to beleeve and build upon our word moſt ſurely; and as if we would make it unimaginable and impoſſible that we ſhould break: but after all this there are men found that have gone to work in the matters of the Oaths and Covenants, as if the direct contrary to what was the ſubject of their Oaths had been the things they had undertaken and tyed themſelves unto; and as if all that they did in entering into thoſe Obligations, and in their proceedings afterward, had been out of a ſtudy to make themſelves and the Land as deeply guilty as they could, both againſt God and man, of Oath and Covenant-violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Here is Religion abuſed unto carnal ends; and that very commonly, plainly, and groſly. Religion hath been for a long time univerſally embraced, and pretended to in <hi>England:</hi> There have of late been many proceed ngs taken in hand about it, yea it hath been one thing which men have held forth and made counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance towards in all their motions and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But, although at firſt, while the face
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:169943:188"/> and gloſs of Religion was new and freſh (like falſe coyn when new minted) it was hard to diſtinguiſh of thoſe pretenſions, but each paſſed for current; yet, having now been uſed and well worn, it is too evident that Religion by very many hath not been taken up in reverence or love to it ſelf, but hath been debaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and attend ſome or other worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Moſt men now look through the vizors of the buſie and reſtleſs Stirrers of theſe times, and diſcern their true faces.

I would be loth to ſay, all men, but I may ſay, men of all intereſts and parties, have ſerved themſelves of it. He hath been no body, that either would not put on a dreſs of Religion, or would uſe it otherwiſe then as a dreſs. We have had much ado about Religion; ample Declarations to all the world; ſolemn Praying and Faſting; vowing and ſwearing; arming and fighting for it; diſcovering of Plots; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniſhing of ſome, even capitally, for attempts againſt it; calling Aſſemblies; inviting in of Brethren to aſſiſt; urging of Acts to be paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:169943:189"/> carryed on by other means. I know this charge is of an odious nature, but being true I dare not omit it. Leſt it may ſeem to come meerly from a raſh or uncharitable Judgment. I will here in ſhort ſet down the Conſiderations which induce it.</p>

There is no man deſires or grants allowance to all Religions, but he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a flat Atheiſt, and cares for no Religion, or a worldly Politician; and the latter may do it, either to drive on an earthly deſign, or to ſuccor the weakneſs of his own Religion or party for the time, until it ſhall become able, either to ſtand out a ſtorm, or maſter its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors. Tolerationiſts would have none ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to wear horns, until their own be grown out; and then, who ſo will not herd with them, hath not horns as ſharp as theirs, ſhall know it: only a diſtinction muſt colour this mutation; and none ſo fit as that of the Popes forge, (by inverſion,) he brought all temporal States and Affairs under his Croſier, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> in reference to Religion; and they muſt have all matters ſpiritual, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

Take notice how men change their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards Religion, (even that Religion which ſtill they profeſs,) and diverſly ſhape and faſhion their poſtures about it, as beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with their carnal ends and concernments: As in point of ſtanding up for Religion; one while Religion is the main Cauſe, another while it is no part of it: one while, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be ſecured and reformed to an higher pitch, we muſt up, arm, and fight, and all muſt be layd at ſtake for it; another while it muſt be deſerted, proſtituted, layd common. And in point of ſetling Religion; one while nothing ſo neceſſary to be conſulted, articled for, and eſtabliſhed, as Religion; another while, not that at all, any thing but that. And in point of Engagements upon Conſcience; one while Oaths and Covenants muſt be impoſed upon Conſcience; another while it muſt be left free, and not urged to them by any penalties; anon it muſt again be fettered and engaged, or elſe beware what follows: And what's the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? It is not that Religion varyeth, or the Rules following it vary, or that theſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make any thing for it; but terrene things are mutable; and who ſo will deſign them, muſt be one of the <hi>Amphiſcis,</hi> and caſt the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his protection one while towards, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while frowards his Religion, as the Sun of his worldly intereſt moves about him.</p>

Religion is a good weapon in their hands, wherewith to oppoſe and perſecute others; they, whom they ſet againſt, attempt againſt Religion, they deny to ſettle Religion, they are not godly: but it is of no ſuch uſe to them, and theirs. Religion is an handſom En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or ſtalking-horſe, wherewith to catch, and draw, and mould others to their turn: if they have occaſion to uſe the favour or ſervice of thoſe whom they deem cordial to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then they are all for Religion, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of thoſe they are inſinuating with; they ſeriouſly profeſs many good intentions and fair promiſes for it; they are ſorry for all by-paſt differences, and hard uſages: But are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo minded and affected? Is their aym in this to oblige themſelves, or thoſe with whom they deal?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men have been noted to appear and act for that way and courſe of Religion which they have been known to be againſt in their judgments and affections; and at other times to ſhrink from or ſhake off that way which they have ſeemed beſt to like and approve: What is the buſineſs? why they purſue their worldly deſign; as hunters do their prey, who are fain ſometimes to refuſe the pleaſant plains, which they had rather be upon, and to run through brakes and buſhes, that they may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their game.</p>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169943:190"/> for Religion, while their carnal end is unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or can be proſecuted under that colour; but when they are poſſeſſors of their drift, they leave Religion to ſee to it ſelf: <hi>Jehu</hi>-like, who drave furiouſly, vented much zeal for the Lord, until he had made his way to the Kingdom, and gotten his Throne ſecured, and then for <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves: Or like a Merchant that takes care for the well furniſhing and ſafe-ſteering of his Ship, whileſt he hath uſe of it to tranſport him and his goods to the places of his Merchandiſe; but when he hath ended his voyage, and gotten into the Port where he would be, he conveys himſelf and his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to Land, and leaves the Ship to the Sea, to ſink or ſwim, or ſail whither it will.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, We may obſerve, thoſe who have held cloſe to the intereſt of Religion, and are ſtill true and conſtant to it, they are the moſt deſerted, deſpiſed, vilified, and diſtruſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Land; while thoſe who are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Temporiſers, are the men looked upon, received into the boſom, promoted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted. Now where Religion is talked of, and the ground and band of all correſpondency and confidence is mens abſolute flexibility, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up themſelves to any publique intereſt for private and ſelf-reſpects ſake, even Charity her ſelf will judg Religion is taken in but upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>It being thus manifeſt, that many mens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs for Religion hath been to ſerve baſe carnal ends, we may gather thence, both what
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:169943:191"/> intolerable abuſe hath been done to Religion, and what guilt is then contracted. 1.

Let us go on to other particulars.</p>
                  <p>Here is a decay, cooling, dying of Religion: we are all generally baptized perſons, profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians; we bear the name of Chriſt, own the Religion of his Goſpel, in oppoſition to, and diſtinction from Heatheniſm, Judaiſm, Turciſm, yea and Popery: We declare for Proteſtantiſm and Reformation; but where is the ſoundneſs, life, vigor, and efficacy of theſe things? If any ſenſe or power of theſe things moved in us at firſt, unto the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, what is become of it? The Lord may ſay of us, as of <hi>Jeruſalem, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, the kindneſs of thy youth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 2.2,</note> 
                     <hi>the love of thine espouſals.</hi> In the beginning of Reformation in King <hi>Edwards,</hi> Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, there was ſome zeal and forwardneſs expreſſed for the truth, and for the pure worſhip of God, in acting for the abolition of Popery, and for Church-Reformation, and in ſufferings unto death: but from that time how ſoon were we
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:169943:192"/> departed? How continuedly have we dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated? How far are we now fallen from that life and fervor? Where are the forward actors? Where are the reſolute Endurers for the Cauſe of God? A zealous, ſtrict, gracious, and fruitful courſe of life and converſation hath all along, by the moſt, been layd aſide, loathed, hated, denyed, and perſecuted. We have of late begun high attempts and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if we would not only recover, but exceed and out-ſtrip our firſt ſettings forth for Religion; but this riſe hath ſeemed to be but like that of a body mortally ſick, or wounded, which in the approaches of death well have one or a few ſtarts and liftings up to recall (as it were) its departing Soul, but is not able to hold up when it is raiſed, and therefore yields preſently again to the ſeizure of death. May we not fear that the late ſtirrings and ſticklings for Reformation were but as ſprints or ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings before death? conſidering how little theſe are ſeconded, yea, how quite flat theſe are layd down, yea what intentions, ſtudies, and practices clean contrary to them, are taken up and practiſed? Methinks, when I conſider the ſtory of <hi>Gideon,</hi> I ſee a lively portraicture of the men of theſe times: <hi>Gideon</hi> at firſt, when in his low condition <hi>(when he threſhed wheat by the wine-preſs, to hide it from the Midianites, and when he confeſſed his family was poor in Manaſſeh, and he was the leaſt in his fathers houſe,)</hi> and the Lord ſet him to throw down the <hi>Altar of Baal, and cut
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:169943:192"/> down the grove by it, and to build an Altar unto the Lord, and to offer thereon a burnt ſacrifice with the wood of that grove;</hi> he was very forward, zealous, and couragious, both in the removing of Idolatry, and erecting the worſhip of the true God: But when he had accompliſhed his great conqueſts, and the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the <hi>Midianites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites,</hi> how then proceeded he in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Religion? Why, <hi>he makes a requeſt to his people for their golden Ear-rings;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 6.11 15. cap. 8 24, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they grant, and ſpreading a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every man therein caſts the Ear-rings of his prey; and he makes an Ephod thereof, and puts it in his City, and all Iſrael goes thither awhoring after it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even thus have men (the <hi>Gideons,</hi> the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men of valor) now delt with Religion: At the firſt, <hi>when they were little in their own ſight,</hi> then down with the <hi>Altar of Baal, and the grove;</hi> down with Idolatry, Superſtition, and all humane Innovations and Inventions in Religion: Then for nothing ſo much as for Reformation, and purity in the Worſhip of God, and in the Miniſtry and Government of his Houſe; but when the Wars are over, and Victory is obtained, then the concluſion about Religion is this; Let every man bring in his <hi>golden Ear-ring,</hi> the uncouth and extravagant Notions and Opinions which he hath taken up during the War (an employment which hath often proved not more hurtful to mens bodies, by bringing diſeaſes, wounds, and death, then
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:169943:193"/> to their minds and ſouls, by breeding Error and vice) and make a many-coloured, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Ephod;</hi> that is, an interwoven mixture, and free Toleration of all theſe, and of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe any will further take up, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; and let all <hi>England</hi> go a whoring after it, according as his deluded phancy ſhall lead him. But that <hi>Ephod</hi> proved a ſnare to <hi>Gideon,</hi> and to his houſe; a ſnare, firſt of ſin, in their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious uſe of it; and then of puniſhment, in fratricide and uſurpation of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and the ſedition and bloodſhed that followed, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. A ſad preſaging pattern. The main pillars and vital parts of Religion, to wit, Piety, Love, Charity, tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Courage, are grown faint, and brought low. It is very plain to be ſeen, that Luxury and Epicuriſm in ſome, worldlineſs in others, and an heretical judgment, or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and contentious ſpirit in a third ſort, hath deadened and deſtroyed Religion: and beſides theſe three ſorts, there are but a few left to keep up any life of it among us.</p>
                  <p>Many of the Diſputes about it, and about the outward ſupport of it by the power of the Magiſtrate, and the ſet maintenance of the Miniſtry, may juſtly be deemed to ariſe from the mean eſteem, cold affection, and nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating wearineſs of it, into which many are declined: They account every thing in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary and burthenſom; any command of it over them, any diligence in its practice, any charge beſtowed on it (though by others)
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:169943:193"/> ſeemeth too much: They fall to queſtion and quarrel with it, as being deſirous to eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of its power, reſtraint, coſt, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.</p>
                  <p>All the dotage, unſetledneſs, and Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm in opinions and ways that is on foot, ſeems to be from a <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> or dead Palſie, ſeized on our Religion: In that diſeaſe there is a decay or ſtop of the <hi>animal ſpirits,</hi> and from thence a reſolution of the <hi>ſinews</hi> and <hi>muſcles,</hi> and ſo a ſtupefaction of the ſenſes, and a looſening of the members and limbs of the body: In ſuch a manner it is now <hi>analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically</hi> with Religion; A dead Palſie hath ſtruck us; the vigor and ſpirits of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are periſhed: and from thence it is that the underſtandings of men are become ſo vain and phantaſtical; their minds and conſciences ſo looſe, unſtable, and extravagant.</p>
                  <p>That zeal, which ſhould heat mens hearts, and warm their affections unto the practice of their duties, and the reſiſtance of groſs errors and ſins, is cold and extinct to that uſe; and enflamed only to ſtrife, and debates of tongue, pen, and hand, either frivolous or plainly hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox and unrighteous. Our unkindly and ſickly heats in Religion have begotten Wars, and theſe Wars have not only deſtroyed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lives, and worldly eſtates of many, but have drawn out the life and blood of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf; and have left it as a cold, mangled, and liveleſs carcaſs.</p>
                  <p>Even in many of thoſe who ſeemed to be
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:169943:194"/> affected to Religion above the generality, it is evaporated into winds of Doctrine, fumes of contention, or flaſhes of high-flown notions or expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>I have culled out theſe, amongſt many of the ſins of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the firſt Table, which ſtand up againſt, and may well out-cry the prayers that are put up for her. For thoſe againſt the ſecond Table, they are alſo as fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant among us. Blood-guiltineſs, injuſtice, and unmercifulneſs, I need not point at; they ſo break out, and fill every place, that there is no room left for my complaint againſt them: Covetouſneſs I have met with afore: Only a word of Pride.</p>
                  <p>Here is pride, even in its height; Luciferian arrogancy: <hi>Pride</hi> was the National ſin of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and after that of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and it brought them both to ruine<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 16 49</note>: and it is now our National ſin as much as ever it was either of theirs, or any others. We have been proud of all the earthly, of all the heavenly bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings God hath given us. We have been proud of our plenty, power, wiſdom, peace, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, impunity, deliverances: We have been proud of our Goſpel-priviledges, of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Reformation, Profeſſion, Miniſters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemlily preferring our Church, Clergy, and Profeſſors, above thoſe of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Our pride appears in our diſcords and jars: If contention be the proper iſſue of pride (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith it is<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 13 10</note>) then we may conclude
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:169943:194"/> our ſelves the moſt pride-ſwollen people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven: for we are abſolutely the moſt broken and divided Nation that is, or ever was (I think) upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Our pride appears in the ſeditious and aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirit that now lifts men up: Every man (almoſt) is a <hi>Korah,</hi> and <hi>takes too much,</hi> yea all, <hi>upon him:</hi> Every man (almoſt) arrogates the higheſt demerit, honor, and power to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſcarce a man to be found, eſpecially of the lower degree and worth, but thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fit and worthy of the chiefeſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and command, and none ſo fit as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is not now, as in <hi>Jothans</hi> Parable, wherein the Trees going to anoint a <hi>King</hi> over them, firſt offered their <hi>Kingdom</hi> to the more noble and profitable Trees, <hi>the Olive-tree, the Fig-tree, and the Vine;</hi> and they refuſing, then to the Bramble: but theſe being rejected, and trambled under-foot, every Bramble aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to himſelf ſuperiority, and will rather ſet all on fire, then not be a Ruler.</p>
                  <p>Our pride appears in that contempt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain which men caſt one upon another: The exalted ſpirits of the Times, as they greaten themſelves in their own eyes, ſo they leſſen and detract from others: they look at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as more then men, at others (their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives in the Land, their Brethren (now, or once) in religious profeſſion; and it may be both in the eyes of God and other men their betters,) as Pagans, or Dogs, not deſerving any reſpect, ſociety, liberty, protection,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:169943:195"/> or ſubſiſtence with them.</p>
                  <p>Our pride appears, in that (like the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, or Amaeziah King of Judah</hi>) we cannot keep at home, but muſt be <hi>enlarging our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> unſatisfiedly,<note place="margin">Hab. 2.5 2 Chro. 25 19</note> and ſtretching our line to, and <hi>gathering unto us all Nations, and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us all people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although we are become a ſhame and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, a proverb and a by-word, a reproach and a taunt unto the Nations that are round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, yet we vaunt and boaſt it out; we ſtand upon tiptoe, we are high and honorable in our own conceits; we glory in our ſelves, yea in our ſhame.</p>
                  <p>In theſe days, in which the ſpirit of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deep ſleep, darkneſs and dotage, is poured out upon us, men dream of a higher meaſure of light, and will needs fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves extraordinary illumination: like <hi>the Prince of Tyrus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 28.12, 13, 14</note> we <hi>ſeal up the ſum, full of wiſdom, and perfect in beauty,</hi> as if we <hi>had been in Eden, the Garden of God,</hi> or were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>anointed Cherubs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next follow, as obſtructers of prayer, the ſins we are guilty of in and about our prayers. If I ſhould take ſcope in them every one ſeverally, I ſhould ſcarce find a way to any end. In brief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:</p>
                  <p>We pray, yet ſin (though open and in impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough in it ſelf) is, as to our diſtinct and convictive acknowledgment, latent and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Many of thoſe ſins that are before the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:169943:195"/> face of God, and ſet in the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (as a vail of ſeparation, ſhutting out our prayers from him) we put behind our backs, or with <hi>Achan</hi> hide in the bottom of our Tent: and ſome of them are juſtified, and entitled to divine approbation and patronage: <hi>Evil is called good, and darkneſs, light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 5.20</note> 
                     <hi>and bitter, ſweet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We pray, yet the heart is unhumbled: All the weight of ſins, the woes of wrath and judgment, the want of our deſires and prayers, break not the heart. After the threefold cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Judah</hi> by the <hi>Babylonian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 44.10</note> the Lord complains of thoſe that were left, <hi>They are not humbled even to this day.</hi> After the treble Civil War, which this Land within theſe few years hath been enflamed with, it is in like manner with us, <hi>We are not humbled even to this day;</hi> nay, we are more unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and hardened at this day then at the firſt.</p>
                  <p>We pray, but our devotion is formal and remiſs: We have prayed and faſted (as we think) long; but how? ſo long indeed that we appear tired out with it: The longer we have continued, the fainter and colder we have been about it; until at laſt we have given it over, in regard of conſtancy in publique; and that (pretendingly) upon this very ground of wearineſs and formality; as if that were a juſt reaſon to deſiſt, which is our ſin; and as if diſcontinuance were not as great a ſin, or greater, and as much or more impedimental
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:169943:196"/> of prayer, as remiſſneſs and formality: and as if conſtancy and aſſiduity in prayer were the cauſe <hi>(per ſe)</hi> and juſtly chargeable with that ſlackneſs; or, the regular way to cure the ill habit and bad conſequents of Cuſtomarineſs in a neceſſary duty were diſuſe.<note place="margin">Job 17.10</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Will the Hypocrite always call upon God?</hi> We ſay, conſtancy in faſting and prayer is the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Hypocriſie, and unconſtancy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                  <p>We pray, but it may be feared we ſeek our ſelves in it, and not God: our ends are carnal, and not ſpiritual;<note place="margin">James 4 3 Hoſ. 7.14.</note> we ask <hi>for our luſts,</hi> not for our Souls: we <hi>aſſemble for corn and wine,</hi> not for the glory and ſervice of God. If our ayms in prayer may be judged by our other endevors, we minde not the Kingdom of God, or the advancement of Religion, in the firſt, or in any place; for what do we act for them? Our own wills, our own intereſts, our own quarrels, are the attractive of our eyes: We look at our own things, and it is well if not (with <hi>Jezebel</hi> in her Faſt) at <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
                  <p>We pray, but is it in mutual charity and forgiveneſs, or in contention and ſtrife? We pray in relation one to another, but is it for, or againſt one another? If irremiſſion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and wrongs do lock up the gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt prayers, who can wonder that the prayers of <hi>England</hi> ſtand without doors? Here are contentions numberleſs, endleſs, irreligious, unpolitique, irrational, bloody, fundamental,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:169943:196"/> and ruining: and without all doubt, as the ſubjects of theſe contentions are the ſubject of mens prayers, ſo the affections that ſtir up, and carry on thoſe quarrels, do move and act in their prayers. There is ſcarce any union or agreement among us in any thing poſitive: that which is betwixt any party ſeems rather to conſiſt in a joynt-differing from and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others (which is the union of Hell) then in a conjunction or concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Well it is,<note place="margin">Iſai. 58.4</note> if men do not now <hi>faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs.</hi> For my part, I will here deal plainly: I admire that the ſubject of publique Faſts ſhould conſtantly be matter of civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſuch things as they that do moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend faſting and prayer do mainly differ in; and that the not publiſhing of thoſe Faſts ſhould be matter of ſnare and penalty to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and they that will not come publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear the Word, to worſhip, or call upon God, either on thoſe, or the Lords own days, ſhould be left free: And is it now come to this, That whereas ere-while coercive proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings might be only in civil matters, and in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:169943:197"/> things of conſcience (as they ſpeak) or of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there might be no compulſion; now what man commands in point of Religion, the indicting or proclaiming of a Faſt to be kept on ſuch a day, may be under a pain; but what God himſelf commands, to wit, the actions themſelves of faſting, prayer, preaching, and hearing, muſt be arbitrary<note n="*" place="margin">If it be ſaid, the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a faſt is no act of Religion, but a civil action only introductory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: it is of the ſame nature with that of a mans travelling from his home unto the publique Aſſembly, and his placing himſelf, and continuing there during the publique worſhip; theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but introductory to performances: why may not then theſe be commanded under a pain, as well as that, or both be left free?</note>?</p>
                  <p>We pray, but we reform not: The gap lies down, the hedg lies open betwixt divine wrath and us, while we continue irreformed.

                  <p>Now how is Reformation minded with us? In ſpecial how is it in relation to the houſe of God? For Superiors, is it not wholly, profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, inexorably layd aſide by them? It is, if I
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:169943:198"/> much miſtake not. For Inferiors, men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally unwilling, impatient of coming under any Rule, either of Confeſſion of Faith, or of Worſhip, or of Government. There was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while nothing but diſputing for and againſt this and that way of Diſcipline, and there was eager contention, each party for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their frame of Government; but now men are generally agreed to let all alone, and to be without any at all, and to leave off all ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Religion: And this is the iſſue which the Tempter (certainly) aimed to bring it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when Reformation was firſt moved in, and he ſtirred up ſo many Commotions, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſuch a multitude of Sects and Civil Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to ſtickle in it.</p>
                  <p>And there are two things which make our irreformedneſs exceeding abominable, and therefore very forcible againſt our prayers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are they that lately drew near to God very ſolemnly in Prayer, Faſting, Oaths, and Covenants, for Reformation of Religion. Now it is a moſt deſperate thing (and ſo no doubt it will be found) for men to dally with God in a work of this nature; for men to ſeek God, and ſwear by him for Reformation, and then to reject and ſtand againſt it. How ſhould God hear our prayers, when we our ſelves hinder them? How ſhould he not deny them, when we our ſelves deny them? How ſhould he anſwer them, when we contradict them? If we make voyd our Prayers and Covenants for his Intereſt, we are impudent unto ſtupidity
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:169943:198"/> if we look for any thing but fruſtration in the remainder of our ſuits.<note place="margin">Exod. 19.8 &amp; 24.3, 7. Heb. 9.18. Deut. 5.27 Exod. 32, &amp; 33.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> hears and receives the Law from Gods own mouth; they make a Covenant with him for its performance <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with blood;</hi> they deſire <hi>Moſes</hi> to go up into the Mount unto God to hear, receive, and bring them down all that the Lord would ſpeak, and they would hear, and do it: but after this, ere <hi>Moſes</hi> could return, and ere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days were expired, they ſet up gods of their own handy work, and a worſhip of their own deviſing; and this made that heavy breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them, for which they payed ſo dear, and were ſo long remembered. This was that which heightened <hi>Judahs</hi> ſin, and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even their univerſal ſeeking and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God, and beginning to act for Reformation under <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and their as general Apoſtacy under <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> And this was that which brought that fearful ruine of the Jewiſh State, and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the <hi>Roman,</hi> after Chriſts time: They generally profeſſed repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and embraced the Baptiſm of it by <hi>John;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat 3.5. Mark 1.5. Luke 7.29</note> but they falſified herein, turning to perſecute and crucifie Chriſt, to withſtand and infeſt his Apoſtles, and to reject his Goſpel. Theſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns ſadly ſpeak to us at this day, who have done the like to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have let ſlip, yea thruſt away the opportunity of Reformation when it ſerved. Formerly the Court and the Biſhops bore the blame of the irreformedneſs of the Church and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:169943:199"/> Nation: of latter days the Malignants and Wars were urged as the impediments of it: but ſince theſe blocks have been removed, and a full opportunity hath been put into their hands who before cryed and petitioned to God and man for it; and I cannot but ſay (if I muſt ſay the truth) in their hands it hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed; the faireſt opportunity that ever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had (and that under the ſtrongeſt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it) hath miſcarryed; nothing wanted but hearts to uſe it. One part hath failed through remiſſneſs in it, and over-much eying other intereſts inferior to it: and another part hath actively withſtood, and put it back, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all concluſions and agreements towards it, kindling new flames, yea traverſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their own principles, councels, and courſes, rather then not interrupt it. Here is irreformedneſs to a height, if not a <hi>non-ultra. This is a Lamentation</hi> (O England) <hi>and ſhall be for a Lamentation.</hi> But I will inſiſt no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the ſins in or about our prayers. I wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo here omit the above-named modal aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our ſins, having purpoſely (for brevities ſake) taken them, or the moſt of them, in, as I have gone over the heads already touched. This ſhall ſerve for the noting out the Reaſons on our part (<hi>viz.</hi> the meritorious Cauſes, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſins) for which the Lord now hideth himſelf from his peoples prayers.</p>
                  <p>For the other ſort of Reaſons, to wit, the final Cauſes, or the Ends which the Lord may have to accompliſh upon us or others thereby;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:169943:199"/> It is not fit or expedient that I deſcend unto the particulars thereof by way of poſitive aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to ſay it is for this or that ſpecial end. It may ſuffice that I have gathered out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and layd down in one <hi>ſeries,</hi> thoſe ſeveral ends for which the Lord declareth to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his peoples prayers: and that further I hear annex theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it is not to be doubted but that the Lord hath a peculiar people in <hi>England,</hi> yea ſuch as are his, not only by external calling and profeſſion, but according to the Election of grace, and that have a ſanctifying and ſaving intereſt in him and his promiſes; ſo queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he hath theſe, or ſome of theſe ends to bring forth in or unto them by his preſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf from their prayers, and in eſpecial from thoſe prayers which they have and do ſtill dayly put up to him for the publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the Church of Chriſt, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for thoſe of <hi>England.</hi> They are of many kinds: ſome of them he may (in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate import) never grant; others of them he doth delay. Thoſe which he may finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his end towards them which he may (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I may without preſumption ſay he doth) aim at, and will accompliſh thereby, is, both to prevent the evil which by their obtaining thoſe petitions might enſue to them, and to provide for, and procure their greater good. Thoſe which he doth for a time delay, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and drift we may conceive and conclude certainly in that delay, is, to bring to paſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:169943:200"/> ſome of thoſe Ends, if not all, which have been before inumerated.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore repeat them over. 1. In relation to them that pray, to encreaſe their aſſiduity and ardency in prayer: To fit them for the mercy prayed for: To exerciſe and try their faith, patience, love, ſincerity of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and obedience: To manifeſt himſelf to them the more fully, either in or after the delay: To make the benefit prayed for the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and welcome, and uſeful when it comes: To remove the impediments of their receiving or enjoying the mercy ſought for: And to raiſe up their thoughts, their faith, hope, love, and longing to the ſecond appearing of Chriſt. 2. In relation unto others: To make up and bring in the number of thoſe for whom the mercy is purpoſed: To compleat the account of the Churches ſufferers and ſufferings: To give others an example of patient and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent waiting upon God: and for the greater diſmay and confuſion of the adverſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All theſe Ends (eſpecially thoſe which concern the perſons praying) as they are good and deſirable in themſelves, and very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be attained ere their prayers come to iſſue; ſo as many of them as we now, upon a diligent view, can diſcern, or apprehend to be unaccompliſhed, we may well conjecture the Lord intendeth to accompliſh them before he perform his peoples prayers; and that the Lords ſtaying, and gradual working for the bringing forth of theſe ends, is the reaſon of his
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:169943:200"/> preſent deferring of thoſe prayers. Now who of the people of God among us can otherwiſe judg of themſelves, or their brethren, but that many of, or all of thoſe ſaid ends which reſpect them, and much of every one of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unattained? and therefore they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve there is very good reaſon for all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay: The Lord hath a great work yet to finiſh out in and upon his people, before he work out their prayers for them.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore this part of mine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the particular Caſe and Query. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider on one hand the ripeneſs and fulneſs of <hi>Englands</hi> ſins, and on the other hand the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity or unripeneſs of thoſe gracious ends which the Lord ſetteth up to be effected in, and by the delay of his peoples prayers; and we have before us abundant matter of Reaſon for that dilatory hiding of God from his people. Again, conſider, if any one of thoſe ſins before recited may (according to Scripture threat or example) ſuffice to hinder the anſwer of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, much more may many, or all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring together, and that with ſo many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and degrees of aggravation, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to that hinderance.</p>
                  <p>Now to the ſecond Propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That plurality of Reaſons which there may be now for this hiding of God from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we cannot reaſonably think aſcribeable wholly to every one, or to any one perſon or party; but we may attribute them to the whole community diſtributively, or diſperſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:169943:201"/> ſo as that ſome of them more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to one, ſome to another, and all to the whole, by way of diſtribution.</p>
                  <p>Theſe meritorious and final cauſes of this effect, and the variety of particulars under each of them, are not to be ſought in, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to every perſon; but ſome of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, obtain, and take place in this perſon, ſome in that. This proceeding of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth and looketh at us all in common and general; yet, as it is with ſome difference of diſpoſition in God (as was above ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3 Sect. 3.</note>,) ſo it is with ſome difference in reſpect of grounds or reaſons in or from men, and with ſome difference alſo in regard of ends for or towards men; all men do not contribute to it by way of provocation in the ſame kinds, acts, or meaſures of ſins: God hath not his ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men alike, or the ſame for nature or degree.</p>
                  <p>I have before diſtinguiſhed of a double no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of God: ſome are ſuch in regard of name, and outward call and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg only: ſome are ſuch in regard of ſpiritual appropriation and communion alſo. It muſt be granted, this carriage of God may be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded on ſome ſins of thoſe, or ſome of them who are the people of God in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſence: and it may be partly for ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful ends towards them, or ſome of them, who are (at preſent) Gods people but in the larger acception. Yet it is moſt likely thoſe that are the people of God in the common
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:169943:201"/> notion only, have the largeſt ſhare in the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſes; and thoſe who are his people in the moſt peculiar notion, have the largeſt portion in the final cauſes. Now for any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſolution by way of application to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or parties, I only ſay, As it is God alone who knoweth particularly who are his by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe degrees of relation, ſo he alone knoweth to allot to every ſingle perſon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part and portion of either of thoſe two ſorts of cauſes. And it is every mans duty, firſt to reflect upon himſelf, and conſider how much he ſhareth in either of them, and then to take notice of them in relation to the whole community.</p>
                  <p>I come to the third Propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although many, moſt, or all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid cauſes may have influence into this caſe of ours, yet ſome of them may be conceived more predominant, and more notable in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the effect, then the reſt; and therefore more neceſſary for us to take notice of, and lay to heart. As among thoſe <hi>three and four</hi> (that is, ſeven, a compleat and full number of) <hi>Tranſgreſſions</hi> of <hi>Judah, Iſrael,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpoken of as the cauſes of the irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their reſpective judgments (<hi>Amos</hi> chap. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.) there is ſtill one or two nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated as the chief or head of the reſt; ſo there is uſually in ſuch a caſe as ours, ſome one or a few ſins that do more appear and prevail then others, in procuring this evil. <hi>Judah</hi> had one ſin <hi>(viz. Idolatry)</hi> that was <hi>written with a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:169943:202"/> pen of Iron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 17.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and with the point of a Diamond; and graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of their Altar.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.5 7.10</note> 
                     <hi>Ephraim</hi> had one ſin (viz. <hi>Pride</hi>) that did <hi>teſtifie to his face.</hi> There is ordinarily to be ſeen upon a ſinful Nation ſome ſin or other,<note place="margin">Iſai. 3.9</note> that <hi>the ſhew of their countenance doth witneſs,</hi> or hold forth; that doth occur at the firſt bluſh, as a mark or brand upon the forehead, and is their proper and predominant National ſin. What ſin or ſins there be in us of this Land, that bear this priority of place and influence, it behoves us to obſerve. I ſhall therefore here plainly ſpeak my apprehenſion: and for that end ſhortly, firſt, give the characters by which (as I conceive) they may be known; and then ſay which I think they are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe ſins (I ſuppoſe) are of this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency and predominancy above others: 1. Which are more general, either in the whole community, or in them that give themſelves to prayer. 2. That are the common root, or mother of other ſins. 3. Which God more apparantly manifeſts himſelf againſt, and ſtrikes at in his croſs providences. 4. Which our Conſciences muſt take to, or reflect on, by way of charge, if not upon our ſelves, yet, at leaſt upon one another. 5. Which the evil under preſent conſideration reflecteth on by way of proportion. Theſe are the tokens by which (as I ſuppoſe) the ſins which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in this effect may be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now which are they? unto what ſins
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:169943:202"/> do theſe tokens more eminently agree? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe characters, or any other rule I have to go by, and upon the moſt conſiderate and impartial ſurvey that I can take of the viſible ſtate and ways of this Nation, the ſins that, among the whole herd, appear to me, as <hi>Saul</hi> did among the people, <hi>higher by head and ſhoulders then any of the reſt,</hi> that is, to be the leading and maſter-ſins, as to the pulling down of other judgments, ſo in ſpecial to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of this, are theſe two: 1. <hi>The groſs diſeſteem, contempt, and rejection of the holy Word, and glorious Gospel of the bleſſed God.</hi> 2. <hi>The high and dear eſteem, advancement, and love of a worldly-private-intereſt.</hi> Theſe two are <hi>Englands</hi> ſins; and (if I much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not) they are the predominant ſins in the obſtruction of the prayers of, or for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the making good of this charge, much needs not be ſaid: who can doubt of it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to either of them? Let me ſpeak a little of them ſeverally, and under that double charge: 1. That they are <hi>Englands</hi> ſins. 2. That they are the reigning ſins of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore of chiefeſt influence in the hindrance of prayers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the contempt and rejection of the Word of God and Goſpel of Chriſt: And of it, 1. That it is <hi>Englands</hi> ſin. 2. That it is <hi>Englands</hi> maſter ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The contempt and rejection of the Word and Goſpel of God is <hi>Englands</hi> ſin: this is
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:169943:203"/> too apparent. We of this Nation are of this guilty all manner of ways, and in the greateſt height. Scarce ever any people have enjoyed the Goſpel ſo freely, ſo generally, ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo long as we; neither hath ever any more vilely deſpiſed and rejected it. <hi>Iſraels</hi> or <hi>Judahs</hi> contempt of the Word of the Lord in the worſt and corrupteſt times (even when <hi>the Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his meſſengers,</hi>

                  <p>The Jewiſh rejection of Chriſt and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when he lived and preached perſonally among them, was not beyond ours of this age and Nation.<note place="margin">Mat. 11.20 &amp;c.</note> Was <hi>Chorazin's, Bethſaida's,</hi> and <hi>Capernaums</hi> impenitency ever a whit more inveterate or upbraidable then is ours?

Popery and Prelacy, or what ever was moſt nauſeated, were not more ſtomacked in the beginning of the late Stirs, then are now Orthodox Preaching and Presbytery with many. And although we have for about theſe hundred years been decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our reſpect to the Word, yet, I dare ſay, we have fallen and degenerated more therein within theſe ten laſt years, then we did
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:169943:206"/> in all the other fourſcore and ten. And what think we doth this haſtening in our defection, and our arrival now at the very loweſt ſtep of it, portend? Certainly, not the ſpeeding of our prayers, but of our puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>What contempt or indignity is there which the Word of God is capable to ſuffer, and we capable to act, which we have not done unto it? In two words. What ever there is in the Goſpel worthy of honour and acceptation, we deſpiſe and vilifie: What way ſoever reſpect and eſteem is to be ſhewed unto it, therein we manifeſt our contempt of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What ever there is in the Goſpel deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and commanding our honour and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we deſpiſe and vilifie. We deſpiſe and vilifie the light of the Goſpel, by affecting ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and love of darkneſs: We deſpiſe its Truth, by changing it into a lye, entertaining or enduring the Errors oppoſite to it, and wreſting it to patronize falſhood and iniquity: We deſpiſe and vilifie its grace, by practical infidelity, or irreconciliation to God, pleaſure in ſin, and earthly-mindedneſs: We deſpiſe and vilifie its holineſs, by Atheiſm, impiety, and hypocriſie: Its righteouſneſs, by injuſtice, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſedition, fraud, falſhood, and perjury: Its purity, by Epicuriſm, luxury, and pride: Its union, peace, and love, by malice, envy, ſtrife, cruelty, and ſchiſm: Its order (laſtly) by Libertiniſm, confuſion, and profanation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What way ſoever there is reſpect and eſteem to be ſhewed to the Goſpel, therein
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:169943:206"/> we manifeſt our contempt of it. There is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be done to it in hearing and reading it; in beleeving it; in obeying it; in profeſſing and adorning it before others; and in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. But we have all theſe ways caſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We contemn it in point of hearing and reading. Look into our Aſſemblies; ſee how they are accounted, followed, frequented. What abſenting, turning away the ear from hearing? what emptineſs is there in the Congregations? Time was, in the primitive age, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Reformation, yea in our memories, no pains, travel, or frequency in repairing to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was too much; now we are overcloyed with much preaching. Erewhile we complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhops for putting down Sermons; but now many of the people do put off more Sermons (I dare ſay) then ever the Biſhops put down. It is now counted by ſome a poor, and low buſineſs for a man to be diligent in following the publick Ordinances; he that cannot with <hi>Elies ſons, kick at Gods Sacrifice, and his offering which he hath commanded in his habitation;</hi> or, at leaſt, fly higher then the Church-aſſemblies, Worſhip, and Sacraments, and the Scriptures too, he is ſcarce one of the godly, or well-affected. Again, look into the diſpoſition of hearers when they are come: May it not be ſaid of divers, yea of the moſt, and in ſome places of all, <hi>Their ear is uncircumciſed, they cannot harken: behold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>the Word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:169943:207"/> delight in it?</hi> The Word of God was unto <hi>David, more deſireable then gold, and ſweeter then honey;</hi> now it is generally nauſeous, and weariſom. How hard, dead, careleſs, diſdainful, quarrelling, are mens hearts unto it? Some can hardly ſtay it out; others can ſcarce refrain their tongues from breaking out againſt it; many come and ſit it out, but their hearts are gone from it. Plain and pure doctrine pleaſeth but a few. Now the common temper of them that lend their ear to hear the Word, is nicety and novellizing. So great is the affectation of novelty, and diſreliſh of ancient and wholeſom truth, that no doctrine will go down with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but what is quaint and new, either for the matter, or the dreſs. Men are never ſwift to hear, but when they ſmell ſomething that is uncouth. The beaten rode of plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar doctrine, though in the Apoſtles ſentence it be ſafe for the hearer<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note>, yet it is no way ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, but tireſome. Again, Look into mens houſes and cloſets: What conſtancy, care, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is there uſed of men in the Reading of Gods Word? Are not the Bibles of many that have them, and can read, caſt into a corner the week through? never taken up, unleſs to carry to and from the Church; ſcarce ever looked upon but when their ear ſhould rather be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in hearing, then their eye in reading: At home they are ſeldom or never opened: What was once ſpoken as a heavy Judgment, is now become a wilful practice,<note place="margin">Iſai. 29.11</note> 
                     <hi>The viſion of all is become as the words of a Book that is
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:169943:207"/> ſealed.</hi> In what account was the Word of God in <hi>England,</hi> when it was firſt tranſlated by Mr <hi>Tindal?</hi> and then, under what peril did many procure and keep it in their houſes? and with what diligence, eagerneſs and pleaſure did they read or hear it? Some that could not read it, hired others with their money to read it to them. Now the Book of God is reputed as ſtrange and antiquated; whileſt Diurnals and Prognoſtications (thoſe worſe then legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary lyars, the one for time paſt, the other for the future; thoſe conſtant publique ſcandals of our Religion and Nation) are in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; upon which it may be doubted the continual uſers of them do beſtow more time and coſt, and its well if they give not more heed and credit to them, then they do upon or to the Word of God. <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, are infamous for the permiſſion of Stews: Is it not as diſgraceful to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to ſuffer ſuch Marts of falſhood, cozenage, and ſlander, as are practiſed by thoſe weekly and yearly Pamphlets? Their officious lyes and flatteries will not be found advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous at all to the State, if the diſhonor and guilt that they lay upon it be well weighed. But I had almoſt in purſuit of theſe ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful abuſes digreſſed; but ſure I am not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In point of believing: we manifeſt our contempt of the Word in this reſpect. That exclamation of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (applyed by the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> and by the Apoſtle

                     <hi>as a moſt precious tryed ſtone, a chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone, a ſure foundation;</hi> but with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes he is <hi>a ſtone diſallowed, ſet at nought and rejected.</hi> If Chriſt were our <hi>ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> there would not be ſo many rents and diviſions: If he were our <hi>tryed ſtone or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See on Iſai. 28.16 <hi>Div.

                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 28.16</note> ſo much impatience and and fear of man, ſuch ſhrinking in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of the way of Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon the leaſt imagination of trouble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In point of obedience: The Word of God conſiſting (in a great part) in Commands, and containing the Will of God which we are to do, and being ſpoken to us for that end, that we may become conform to the Will of God, the moſt immediate, direct, and real contempt of it (after we come to know it) is diſobedience to it. Now our contempt of it in this reſpect breaks forth moſt notoriouſly,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:169943:208"/> and in all kinds of contumacious and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carriages: how unſubjugate we generally are thereto, would be endleſs to diſcover. Look into our Congregations (once again) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the power, ſucceſs, and fruit of the Word of God herein: who almoſt is there that <hi>gives up himſelf to the Lord?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.5 Rom. 6.17</note> who that <hi>obeys from the heart that form of doctrine unto which he is delivered?</hi> May not the Lord ſay of us, as of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſometimes,<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.2, 3</note> 
                     <hi>I have ſpred out my hands all the day unto a rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which walketh in a way not good, after their own thoughts; a people that provoke me to anger continually to my face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a ſort of men among us, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and deny the binding power of the Moral Law of God unto Chriſtians; but we are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practical <hi>Antinomians:</hi> When the Commandments of God are delivered unto us, though we do not flatly ſay unto him, as the <hi>firſt ſon</hi> (in the <hi>Parable) unto his father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.28</note> 
                     <hi>We will not go;</hi> yet we do as the <hi>ſecond ſon</hi> did, who anſwered his father, <hi>I go Sir, and went not.</hi> The Land is full of nothing ſo much as of diſobedience, and contemptuous violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Commandments of God, and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. We caſt off and abrogate the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of both <hi>Teſtaments:</hi> We reject both <hi>Law and Gospel:</hi> we not only <hi>break in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bands of the Lord,</hi> but we <hi>caſt away the cords of his anointed:</hi> the <hi>eaſie and light yoke of Chriſt</hi> is refuſed. The general vote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, even againſt Chriſt himſelf, is, <hi>We
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:169943:209"/> will not have this man to reign over us:</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both the impetuous reſiſtance that hath been made againſt his regiment in his houſe, and the ſearedneſs of mens Conſciences, and ſetledneſs of their lives in all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>As there are <hi>Antinomians</hi> who take away the Authority of the Law of God, ſo there are men that are <hi>anti</hi> or <hi>Hyperordinancists,</hi> who take away or antiquate the force of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Inſtitutions. But the generality are ſuch in practice, whileſt they pretend to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and yet make no conſcience of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe of the Ordinances of Chriſt: they either content themſelves to be wholly without the Lords Supper, and all exerciſe of Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, or are reſolved not to have them, but in what manner they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In point of profeſſion, and adorning of it before others: Our deportment towards the Goſpel is utterly unworthy of it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming it: The reproach and ſcorn which it lieth under among us, and abroad, through the carriage of them that make profeſſion of it, is very odious. Divers contemn the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it actively, many accounting it too ſtrict and preciſe for them to own: others make uſe of it as of a garment to put on or off as they ſee occaſion; or as a Summer garment, which they only put on in fair and warm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lay aſide in the cold and ſtormy winter of perſecution: and a third ſort eſteeming it too low, childiſh, and formal
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:169943:209"/> for them, they muſt have a pitch above Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Revelations and Rules. But the grand reproach which we lay upon it is paſſive, whileſt we aſſume to our ſelves this profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but miniſter occaſion to others to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at, and ſpeak evil of it through us. Some under a profeſſion of the Goſpel hold fundamental Errors againſt it, and yet ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to patronize and defend them by it; nay, they account them the only Evangelical men, who invent, or receive and maintain unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Doctrines: others under that profeſſion live licentiouſly, and work all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and break down all bounds of duty, either reſpecting God or man; and by means of both thoſe ſorts the way of Truth is moſt vilely blaſphemed.</p>
                  <p>Multitudes (if I may not ſay the greateſt number) of us have no more of Chriſt then meerly what may make them capable of being a ſcandal to his Goſpel, to wit, the water of Baptiſm upon their faces, and the Name of Chriſt in their memories and mouths: In all other reſpects common Heathens are as much if not more Chriſtian then they.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all: what is publiquely known and ſpoken of, methinks it ſhould not offend any, if I mention; and indeed I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uprightly paſs it by. There are thoſe that have made a higher and more ſingular profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel then the reſt, by whom it now ſuffers moſt, as in ſome other reſpects, ſo in point of infamy: not only the Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:169943:210"/> profane and ignorant, but many other, both weak and ſtrong in the faith among us; nor only they, but the Nations about us are ſcandalized at us, and our profeſſion, for ſuch mens ſakes: not only our Proteſtant Brethren, Friends and Favorers, are aſhamed, grieved, ſtumbled, and weakened; but the Papiſts (and it may be others at more diſtance from us) have their mouths opened in deriſion and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy at us by reaſon of them: yea, and theſe laſt make out from their doings a ſerious and inſinuating argument to juſtifie their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and proſelyte others. But what is the matter? The ſwarms of Sects and Hereſies, the helliſh Blaſphemies, the endleſs and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diviſions that have been ſpawned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhroud of profeſſion, not of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and plain garb, but gilded with the ſhew and ſurface of extraordinary devotion, zeal, and Scripture-knowledg, or higher light. To theſe add the horrid, multiformed, and reſtleſs Seditions and Anarchies that have been devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their heads, and acted by their hands, whoſe faces have looked intently towards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For theſe things we are famed in other Lands as a brood of Monſters in Religion, and a pack of Rebels and State-firebrands in point of political order: and, which is worſe, the Goſpel, Reformation, Proteſtaniſm are made an abhorring, or to ſavor ill with people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and at home. I do not affirm all the ſcandals that may be taken or layd upon us, or our profeſſion, or any party; neither do I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:169943:210"/> to the extending of any of them to all the Nation, as the Authors thereof: Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are meer patients; ſome things may be meer ſlanders, or ſlanderouſly aggravated: There are whoſe faces bluſh, and their hearts bleed; but their hands are clear of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. But this I ſay, there is too much fire, from the which ariſeth all the ſmoke and clouds of reproach: There is truth and guilt, more then enough to occaſion, if not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (conſidering how the world is diſpoſed to conſtrue and ſpeak of the actions of ſuch as we) theſe blurrs. I am perſwaded there is more of ſuch truth and guilt then hath ever other-where been found among any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, For the maintenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: Who ſtands up for it? who is on the Lords ſide? who ſets himſelf really for the defence of the Goſpel? Some <hi>depart from the Faith by giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits:</hi> The <hi>love of others waxeth cold, becauſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity abounds:</hi> Others <hi>wither away, and are offended becauſe of tribulations ariſing for the Word.</hi> And into theſe three ſorts, the moſt with us are at this time reducible.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of the written Oracles of God are gainſay'd; the fundamental Truths thereof, ſummed up into Articles of publique Confeſſion, are contradicted. What remedy is there from men? what effectual vindication is afforded? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thought it a ſtrange thing, that he being to anſwer for the

                  <p>It may well be feared, that one ſpecial ſin, for which the Lord giveth the Sword a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſo that Proteſtant People and States war one againſt another, is, their not <hi>contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Faith;</hi> their not <hi>warring againſt the Synagogue of Satan, the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, and the unclean ſpirit;</hi> their harbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea, the promoting of <hi>Baalamites, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans, and Jezebels.</hi> It was obſerved, that the Civil Wars of theſe Nations followed immediately upon the Court-countenancing of Popery, and other Hereſies, and the allowance given to Innovations in Religion and Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lords-day. Happily they that then made this obſervation may have occaſion to make the like now upon the ſame, and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Tolerations, wherein their own hands may be found with the deepeſt.</p>
                  <p>As the Truth and Ordinances of the Goſpel are delt with, ſo is the Miniſtry thereof: In
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:169943:211"/> ſtead of maintaining, it is denyed, invaded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, undermined, deſpoyled, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced. They that are in ſuperior place are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jealous of any that ſhall diſown their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or take up Arms without their warrant: they take ſuch acts to be very diſhonorable and treaſonable againſt them; but the power which our Lord hath given to the Stewards of his Houſe<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 12.46</note> is denyed; the warfare which he hath ordered and committed to certain hands<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 1 18 2 Tim. 2.3</note> is uſurped at every ones pleaſure. It is now noted for one ſtep or qualification for him that would obtain favor or preferment, that he get up into the Pulpit ſome other way then by the ſtairs and door; that he have the preſumption to preach of himſelf: Whileſt this is the way of riſing, the calling and work of the Miniſtry advanceth not, but goeth down. The Goſpel preached is compared by our Saviour to a Treaſure, which he that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will ſell all that he hath to buy: but now there is many a one that had rather buy any thing then it; that had rather ſell then buy it; that in ſtead of ſelling all for it would ſell (or take) all from it.</p>
                  <p>But I have gone far enough with the firſt part of our charge in relation to the firſt ſin, the contempt of the Word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is <hi>Englands</hi> ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is, This contempt of Gods Word is <hi>Englands</hi> reigning ſin, and ſo of chiefeſt influence in the prevention of our prayers. This may be evident by a brief ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:169943:212"/> of the afore-given characters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a general ſin, whether we reſpect the whole community, or the company of them that give themſelves to prayer. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is generally, in regard of places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, preached and heard, and (in a manner) as generally contemned and rejected. All thoſe among us, <hi>to whom the reproach of it is a burden,</hi> will confeſs, that by the multitude it is (and hath been from the firſt) diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and diſaccounted; although they draw near unto it with their lips and ears, in ſeeming to attend, and in making profeſſion of it, yet all real and hearty eſteem and entertainment they deny it. If ſome in the ſeveral places where it is preached do cleave unto it (as there did at <hi>Athens</hi> unto <hi>Paul</hi>) the generality look <hi>contemptuouſly or ſtrangely</hi> at it.<note place="margin">Act. 17.34</note> It is with us, as once with <hi>Judah</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> and <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> days:<note place="margin">Iſai. 28.9 Jer. 6.10.5.4, 5</note>

To whom ſhall I ſpeak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold their ear is uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and they cannot harken: behold the Word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. Go to the poor, they are fooliſh, for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God. Go to the great men, and ſpeak unto them, theſe have altogether broken the yoke, and burſt the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:169943:212"/> bonds.</hi> That which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>go, and write in a Table, and note in a Book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever,</hi> concerning that peoples <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſing the Word of the Lord,</hi> may be alſo ſet before us, as a Diagram ſuiting us: I deſire therefore the Reader to peruſe it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. verſ. 8. unto 13.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Scriptures do like a glaſs repreſent our faces, and that as truly and fitly as they did theirs: we are thus univerſally (old and young, rich and poor, high and low) wayward and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the common root and mother of other ſins, and therefore the predominant and reigning ſin. All the many and mighty ſins that break out, and overflow in this Land, do own and father themſelves upon this, the contempt and rejection of the Word of God: The tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling under foot of this, is the opening of the floodgates to the inundation of all ſorts of crimes.</p>
                  <p>A few inſtances may here ſerve. This is the cauſe of that Atheiſm, ungodlineſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs that prevails in many among us: The contempt of God himſelf immediately and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably follows upon the contempt of his Word: <hi>He that despiſeth you, despiſeth me:</hi>

                  <p>This is the cauſe of that diſorder, diſcommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and anti-diſciplinary carriage and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition appearing in the Church of God among us. Men are come, through pride and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate luſts, to ravel and trample under foot that order and authority which the <hi>Apoſtles of Chriſt</hi> from him have delivered unto us in the Word; as ſometimes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in ſome particulars did<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 17, &amp;c. 2 Cor. 10 8.</note>.

                  <p>This is the cauſe of the warrantleſs and bold uſurpation of the work of the Miniſtry in preaching: The Word of God is become baſe and mean in the eyes of people, therefore it is thought a light and eaſie work to diſpenſe it; any man is fit enough for it, no matter who takes upon him to ſpeak it: Mens irreverence to it hath begotten arrogant and unskilful ſpeaking of it: As <hi>Jereboam,</hi> when he and the

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe of that baſe fear of men, and obſequiouſneſs to their commandments, even where perſons are convinced otherwiſe in their conſciences. <hi>Laying aſide the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, ye hold the tradition of men.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Both the Word and Providences of God are perverted and miſapplyed; they are become unto many <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, and a ſnare,</hi> upon which they <hi>ſtumble, and fall, and are taken</hi> in error and pernicious ways.

                  <p>We are divided, and ſet one againſt another in numberleſs breaches and quarrels, in matters divine and humane, publique and perſonal: Wherefore is it?

That ſo it is, I ſhall not go about to confirm by reaſon or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; it is ſufficient to refer to, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evidence thereof is, the ſenſe and dictate of every mans conſcience; of theirs, eſpecially, who are cordially obſervant of the evils we lie under from God, and of the incentives of them from our ſelves. There may be indeed, yea there is partiality and indulgence in every one to himſelf: Few of us ſmite upon our own breſts, or ſay each one to himſelf, This Soul is guilty hereof: But the contempt of Gods Word is ordinarily in mens mouths as a charge upon others, and is noted for a ſin of this
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:169943:217"/> reigning nature, and predominant influence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſt of all, The evil under preſent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration (the Lords hiding from our prayers) looketh full upon this ſin by way of proportion and ſimilitude. This deſertion is an anſwerable puniſhment or correction to that ſin. It is one denyal, one put off for another: We harken not to God in his Word; and God harkeneth not to us in our prayers: We manifeſt no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Gods Word; God manifeſteth no pleaſure that he takes in our ſeekings of him. The Goſpel of peace is not entertained with acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ptance by us; we receive not an anſwer of peace to our ſupplications: We yield not to God; God yields not to us: We defer our obedience to his Will; and he delays the grant of our wiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt maſter Sin of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other I now come unto; to wit, the high and dear eſteem, advancement, and love of a worldly-private-Intereſt. This and the former ſin are uſually to be met with together; they are like two German Siſters, or Twins, that are born and grow up together. Where the Word of God falls, and lies under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and loathing, there an earthly-ſelf-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt lifteth up its head, and carries mens hearts and adorations after it: and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> where worldly-intereſt gains favour and eſteem, there the Goſpel comes into diſgrace and diſreſpect. The Word and the World are as contraries, that do mutually expel and remove one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:169943:217"/> Earthly-mindedneſs is the Anti-Goſpel, Antichriſtian Sin. The Goſpel ſets up the life of Faith; Earthly-mindedneſs ſets up the life of Senſe: That carries to things unſeen, and eternal; this fixeth on things ſeen, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Chriſt calleth us out of the world; this ſetteth up our reſt in the world. Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to forſake all that we have; this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to graſp at all the world, and hold faſt all that we can get. Chriſt conquers the world unto us; this captivates us to the world. Chriſt teacheth us to deny our ſelves; this wills us to love and ſave our ſelves. And as theſe two (the contempt of the Word, and the adoring of Self-Intereſt) are bred, and live together; ſo they concur and work together for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of prayers. It is the latter I am now to ſpeak to; and for brevities ſake I will joyntly aſſert, that it is the ſin, and the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin of <hi>England</hi> as to this effect.</p>
                  <p>What is now the profeſſed ſtudy, care, and projection? what is the labour, ſtrife, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of men? It is to make themſelves rich, high, ſafe, free, and potent; and that with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no reſpect to Religion, Conſcience, other mens, or the publique Intereſt. The Land, though it be very full of various opinions and parties, divided and ſubdivided in point of Judgment, yet it is not ſo full of them, as it is of particular Intereſts, each whereof is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its owner above the whole. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed lately new-termed a Commonwealth; but let it be without offence, if I ſay what is
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:169943:218"/> undenyably true, and plain to be ſeen, to wit, theſe two words: 1. Private Wealth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Poverty were never more procured then ſince we were a Commonwealth. 2. If it had not been for private-wealth and Intereſt, the Commonwealth had not had ſo many friends and followers.</p>
                  <p>It hath been in divers ages a catching opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Faith and Religion brings a kind of temporal right, or an earthly priviledg, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and preheminence. The <hi>Jews</hi> extracted ſuch a worldly notion out of the Promiſes and Priviledges they had by their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thoſe they expected by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>

                  <p>What hath ſtirred up and fomented all the unhappy Wars and Contentions among us? The genuine and main cauſe hath been the competitions and emulous conivalſhip of the ſeveral adverſe parties about this ſelf-earthly-intereſt: The true ſtate of the many quarrels hath been, which ſhould be great in rule and riches. I know other things have been more ſpoken of, held forth, and inſiſted on, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſpecious; We have been called out to appear for <hi>Religion, the fundamental Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment in the three Eſtates, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:169943:220"/> of Parliament, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Peace and common Good of the three Kingdoms:</hi> But the upſhot of theſe agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath diſcovered what was the firſt moving cauſe of them in many perſons. We may (I think) infallibly conclude that to have been the end and laſt aym, and firſt mover in any undertaking, unto which it is uſed and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when it is accompliſhed. Now whether the victories, power, and peace attained by the adventures and commotions, have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the poſſeſſors of them unto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and thoſe other intereſts held forth, or unto ſelf-worldly-intereſt, I leave to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial obſervers, yea to the perſons themſelves, to judg.</p>
                  <p>What's the reaſon Religion goes not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? the Reformation and Settlement of it is, or hath, until very newly, been, at the one end of every buſineſs, and of every Declaration, and yet it is not effected, nor really promoted? The reaſon is, This Intereſt comes ſtill in the way, and croſſeth it. It ſometimes conſiſts with, or forwardeth a private temporal deſign, to ſeem zealous and reſolved for Religion; but a through, zealous courſe unto activity and performance doth ſeldom ſtand with the ſaid deſign: and therefore when it becomes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, it is ſhifted off. The <hi>Jews,</hi> being ſet upon their Domeſtique Intereſts, ſay, <hi>The time is not come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hag. 1 2</note> 
                     <hi>the time that the Lords Houſe ſhould be built.</hi> The like excuſes men now find to lay down Reformation, and from
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:169943:220"/> the ſame root: Men ſay, <hi>The time is not for it, the way is not found out, or clear, the State is not ſecure, men will not be brought in, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors do not countenance, there is little hope of doing any good, they dare not ſtrain upon mens conſciences;</hi> and ſuch like put-offs are alledged. But what? <hi>Gehazi</hi> can make it a time to receive moneys (and to ſtrain for that) to buy Lands, to bring men in by the horn for his own purpoſe, and to over-aw Conſcience for his own turn.</p>
                  <p>What's the reaſon of the diſcontents, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and tumults among us? Men are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed with a jealous, repining, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpirit. No man (ſcarce) containeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within his place, or enjoyeth his mind: Nothing but murmuring and grudges at, or claſhing and thwarting with one another. Whence is this <hi>Erinnis,</hi> or malecontented, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent diſpoſition? Why thus it is: The heart is vehemently, inordinately, impatiently ſet upon this worldly Intereſt, to have and enjoy it in peculiar. The ſtate of the World is a limited and ſcant poſſeſſion, there is not room or extent enough in it to ſuffice all its Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: every one therefore labors to encloſe and ſequeſter it to himſelf,<note place="margin">Iſai. 5.8</note>

We ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet among our ſelves while our minds are paſſionately addicted to this worlds goods, wherein there is not <hi>room.</hi> The ſcantineſs of this Intereſt, and the boundleſſneſs of mens affections to it, hurries us into uproars and confuſions about it. This <hi>oportet habere;</hi> this Intereſt is the <hi>Diana,</hi> the <hi>magnifico</hi> of theſe times, and the jealouſie that men are in of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred one by another in their proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, is that which ſtirs them up (like <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius and fellow craftſmen</hi>) to make head, and run into parties, and fill all with noiſe and diſorder. The lower ſort ſtart up, and ſtrive to lay hold on, and get it to themſelves: The higher ſort having it, travel and employ their heads and hands to keep and enlarge it for themſelves and theirs: The mean would be great, the great would be greater, the greater would be yet the greateſt, or great alone: hence all our commotions, and combuſtions, and feaveriſh furies. We are become like the raging waves of a tempeſtuous Sea, that ſome at, and break themſelves one upon another. It is obſerved, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Chriſts time</hi> being ſet upon the expecting and longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an earthly Deliverance, Kingdom, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom as about that time they looked for, they were thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very prone to Sedition and Inſurrections againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> State; and exceeding apt to ſet up, or embrace falſe Chriſts (which was the reaſon of our Saviours cautions to his, <hi>to

                  <p>What makes men ſo groſly and diverſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply both Scripture and Providences? The plain ſence of Scripture is wreſted, and the clear Authority of it is obſcured; and it is from hence: Mens conſulting their worldly intereſt, blinds the mind, and corrupts the judgment, and ſilenceth, if not ſeareth, the Conſcience.

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.22 23</note> ſo that it ſeeth nothing, though never ſo evident, but what agreeth with it.

                  <p>What's the reaſon of that deluſion (above touched) of a temporal felicity, earthly promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enrichment and power by Religion or Chriſtianity?

                  <p>What's the reaſon of the many ſcrued and conſcience-relucting compliances that men make now adays? Some men can ſay, ſwear, ſubſcribe, act, oppoſe any thing, as the times turn: their private intereſt is the oyl that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples them, the ſhooinghorn that draws on what would otherwiſe pinch. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome carnal and ſelf-intereſted Chriſtians in the primitive Church deviſed ways of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating their Religion with the ſtrain of the times and people where they lived; and this was for their beloved worldly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake.

That thoſe evaſions and compliances will not ſerve, they muſt be thundered, frighted out of thoſe their <hi>Zoars,</hi> greater tryals muſt ſift them out of thoſe holes. 2. That men will hardly ſtop at their preſent ſhifts, but that thoſe will diſpoſe them to admit of greater, wider compliances: <hi>And what will they do in the end thereof?</hi> It may come to that again, whether you will carry a Taper, and bear a fagot to the fire, in renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Proteſtantiſm.</p>

The Country charge the Soldiery with it, the Soldiery lay it upon them of higher place and office. Clients and Suiters complain of it in Courts and Judicatories, and they again retort it. The Miniſters reprove it in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                  <p n="6">6. To conclude: This is a ſin which the evil under preſent conſideration (the Lords hiding from prayers) reflecteth on by way of proportion: This evil is a ſuitable retaliation to that fault. In having recourſe to God by prayer, we make profeſſion to place our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Heaven: but, if under that profeſſion our hearts, our dependencies be nevertheleſs upon the Earth, it is but ſuitable that God ſhould put us back, and our intereſt in Heaven deſert us in our recourſe to it: In ſo doing God doth but ſay to us, as he did once of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; Where are their gods,</hi>

                  <p>If our ambition and aim be to be great and potent in this world, we muſt think to be but weak in Heaven: If we will court the world, we muſt expect but cold entertainment with God: If we make the world our friend, we muſt look that God ſhould be ſtrange to us: If the world be in all the requeſt with us, we ſhall be but in little requeſt with God. <hi>Jacob</hi> was <hi>a Prince with God,</hi> when he was but

                  <p>HAving gone through this enquiry <hi>[What may be the Reaſon of the Lords hiding himſelf from his Peoples Prayers grounded upon his Promiſes?]</hi> I have in a manner an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the whole Query propounded in the beginning of this Chapter: Only whereas it was divided into two parts<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note>, and the latter [which is, <hi>What may be the Reaſon of the Lords ſeeming by his Providences to anſwer the Prayers which are contrary to thoſe of his People?</hi>] I have directly and diſtinctly ſaid nothing unto; I ſhall therefore here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, but in one word. The reſolution of the former I take to be the main, both in point of neceſſity, and in the intent of the Propoſer: and it is moreover in effect the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of this latter: for the prayers in the former, from which the Lord hides himſelf, and the prayers in the latter, which ſeem to be anſwered by him, are ſuppoſed to be contrary to each other; ſo that the ſuſpenſe of the one
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:169943:227"/> is the ſucceeding of the other: and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which move God to hide himſelf from the one, and to anſwer the other, are the ſame, eſpecially in relation to the people of God. In a word therefore, the Reaſons for which the Lord ſeemeth by his Providences to anſwer the prayers which are contrary to his peoples, may be twofold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In relation to them that pray thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary prayers: It is in wrath to them, and in judgment againſt them. This it muſt needs be; for the prayers of the people of God are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed to be (at leaſt for matter) good, and agreeable to the Will of God: the prayers then that are contrary to them muſt needs be for their matter ſinful, as repugnant to the revealed Will of God, or rule of Prayer; and what is ſo ſinful, ſucceſs therein muſt needs be in wrath and judgment. For a man to proſper in his evil way, to bring his wicked devices to paſs, though he joyn prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it cannot but be his ſin; yea, his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>junction of that holy performance of prayer, with his unlawful enterprize, much addeth to his ſin<note n="*" place="margin">As the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Phariſees</hi> devouring Widows houſes, &amp; for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king long prayer, made their condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the greater. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14</note>: and that which is the proper fruit or product of ſin, muſt needs be judgment and puniſhment.

                  <p>FIrſt, when the Lord hideth himſelf from his Peoples Prayers, as is above-ſaid, there are ſome miſcarriages into which we are apt to ſlide, and of which we are to beware. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> being in ſuch a caſe as this, determined thus with himſelf:<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.1</note>

This is to be our courſe: There are divers miſdemeanors we are in th s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition propenſe unto, and therefore we muſt

For whether it was upon ſpecial revelation, or upon the written Word that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was ſo bottomed, it was ſtill but by force of a divine word or promiſe; the difference 'twixt thoſe two lies but in the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. The promiſe which all Beleevers have in the written Word for the ſucceſs of their prayers, is as firm and certain as that which <hi>David</hi> built on could poſſibly be. The Lord telleth all his people (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.18, 19.) in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thus much: <hi>He is the Lord that created the Heavens, that formed and made the Earth, and eſtabliſhed it. And as he created it not in vain, but to be inhabited; ſo he hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſeed of Iacob to ſeek him in vain: As ſure as he made the Earth to be inhabited, ſo ſure he hath ordered his people to pray, that he may perform, and they may poſſeſs their prayers.</hi> What can be a ſurer teſtimony to the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:169943:242"/> validity of any thing, then that aſſeveration of our Saviour is for the validity of prayer?<note place="margin">Luke 18 7.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night unto him? I tell you, that he will avenge them ſpeedily.</hi> I tell you; If Chriſt tell us ſo in his Goſpel, it is as ſure as if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit told us ſo by his inſpiration to us. Can there be a firmer bond to aſcertain us, then is that tye which we find betwixt the ſpirit of prayer poured out, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. and the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and anſwer of prayer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.9. And from this we may aſſuredly conclude, God hath not in theſe days poured out the ſpirit of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and thereby put his ſervants on ſo univerſally, ſolemnly and earneſtly to pray, yea and to enter into ſuch vows and covenants, but it is for a great and gracious end, at leaſt to themſelves, in which he will ſpecially manifeſt himſelf to <hi>be their God, and they to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Prayers and tears have been accounted the Churches weapons; and doubtleſs what is ſaid of <hi>the bow of Ionathan,</hi>

                  <p>And as the aſſurance that is given to prayer in general is ſo ſtable, ſo is that which is given in ſpecial to the prayers of the deſerted. <hi>The needy ſhall not alway be forgotten: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever: The Lord will not caſt off for ever; but,</hi>

                  <p>Lay we all this together, and conſider (for our perſwaſion to wait upon God patiently) how theſe Worthies for holineſs and favour with God (recorded in Scripture for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:169943:247"/> and types in patience and comfort) have been put to wait long and long for the iſſue of their prayers; and have been brought to great extremities in divers reſpects during their wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There are yet ſome other Motives unto this to be pointed at.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord defers for a time, and hides himſelf from his own intereſt: May we not then bear his delay in ours? God ſomewhile lets alone, and leaves unrighted and uncleared the concernments of his own Name, Glory, Truth, and Juſtice. Notwithſtanding <hi>his eyes are purer then to behold evil, or look on ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> (that is, with indulgence, or without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation towards it,) yet <hi>he looketh on them that deal treacherouſly,</hi>

                     <hi>and refrained my ſelf; now will I cry like a travelling woman, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth himſelf, enduring the dayly increaſing provocations of his enemies, unto a woman that goes for divers moneths with child, while it biggens in her womb, and is her dayly load.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As God makes us to wait upon him, ſo he himſelf waits upon us. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you.</hi>

                     <pb n="474" facs="tcp:169943:248"/> Beſides the infinite diſparity which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the perſons waiting, him and us, Gods waiting is for far longer time, and with more ſufferance then is ours: He waits for us long, before we come in to ſeek him; and he waits after we ſeek him for our fitting to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He in waiting on us, not only bears our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, but many indignities and offences which we offer him all along, deſerving his refuſal to wait on us any longer, and that he ſhould not only defer us, but flatly and finally deny us all our requeſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The iſſue and anſwer of our prayers is coming on and approaching towards us, though we diſcern not its coming: Our prayers are ne'r the further off for our not diſcerning their progreſs or nearneſs to effect. A <hi>Ship</hi> is ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on toward its Harbor in the darkeſt night, or blackeſt weather, when the Mariners cannot tell whether they be going backward or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The <hi>ſeed</hi> in the Winter lying under ground is taking root in order to a Spring and Harveſt, though it appear not above ground, but ſeem dead and loſt. So it is with our prayers.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Moſt Chriſtians (as it is to be doubted) bear delays of their prayers in greater matters then thoſe, or the moſt of thoſe things which the caſe in hand reſpecteth, and do content themſelves indifferent well to wait under thoſe delays. Conſider your inward eſtate: Do not you dayly pray againſt divers ſpecial corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptations within; and for many
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:169943:248"/> precious graces, with conſummation in glory? and do not thoſe ſuits yet (in a great meaſure) depend ſtill in the Court of Heaven, and you ſatisfie your ſelves in an expectation and hope of them referred to Gods own time? There is no reaſon why we ſhould be more impatient about Externals, whether private or publique, or about Eccleſiaſticals or Spirituals that are not eſſential or conſtituent, no not ſo much as integral, but only ſubſervient unto the eſtate of grace, then we are about the Subſtantials of our Souls: If we were more intent upon, and touched with the deferring of theſe, we would endure the neceſſary delay of thoſe more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedly.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Conſider (laſtly) If we be unfit for the receiving and enjoying of thoſe publique bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we are put to wait for, it is better for us as yet to want, then to have them. We think the neceſſity and worth of the things prayed for is ſo great, that there is no place for any ſtay, every hours delay is our undoing or great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment: but ſee whether we be ready or no for the mercies ſought and waited for. If the things be of high worth and weight, the more pity it is they ſhould, and the more care will God take that they may not miſcarry; and miſcarry they will in our hand, if they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be prepared for them: Whether we be fit for the return of thoſe prayers that now ſtick in the birth, our ſelves may eaſily judg. If we had Religion, a Church and State ſetled (in regard of Rule, Platform, or Order, enacted
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:169943:249"/> and agreed to) by the undoubted ſquare of the Word of God, with all eaſe and ſecurity from Arms and War, what could we do with ſuch a fabrick? are there hands, and heads, and hearts among us capable to bear and carry it on? Can we furniſh out a ſufficient number of perſons prudently, faithfully, and unitedly to manage the ſame? Of our ſuitableneſs for ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we have given ſome taſte, if not a large teſtimony, in the attempts and tranſactions hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; and I do not ſee that (generally) men are now grown wiſer, holyer, or honeſter by all the even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.33</note> This was it; and therefore, notwithſtanding all the aforeſaid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, <hi>the high places were not taken away.</hi> We now look at impediments among or about us, as not having all thoſe furtherances which <hi>Judah</hi> then had of Reformation, but (I dare ſay) the great bar is our own incapacity.

                  <p>But thus much of the fourth Duty, there is yet one more.</p>

                  <p>It appears the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to ſee the Roman Church, and it was for a very holy end, <hi>viz.</hi> the eſtabliſhment and edification thereof; but yet where he mentions his prayers in reference to it, as he doth twice in his Epiſtle to them, he in both places taketh in <hi>the Will or good pleaſure of God,</hi> as the modification of his prayers:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.10 <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.32.</note> The form in which he prayeth is worth obſerving; <hi>Making requeſt (if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by

                  <p>It is ſaid by the Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. wherein Gods hiding from his people is purpoſely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of as the ſubject of the whole Pſalm) <hi>The poor committeth himſelf unto thee,</hi> verſ. 14. or, as the margent, <hi>the poor leaveth himſelf to thee:</hi> that is, he refers himſelf and his cauſe over unto God, to be heard and maintained as he ſeeth good; he doth not limit or preſcribe God a method or time, but leaves the way, ſeaſon and order unto Gods circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Let us then in praying for our own wills ſubmit to Gods; and be content either to have, or want, either to ſtay, or forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as he ſhall think to diſpoſe.

There is no reaſon why we ſhould at all be aggrieved at God for the deferring or denying of any of our ſuits; we muſt learn with <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>lay and leave our complaint upon our ſelves.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 10.1.</note> When we pray to God, we have more cauſe (with <hi>Abraham</hi>) to reflect upon our own unworthineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate his anger for our ſpeaking to him, then to be angry at him, if he do not at all, or not ſpeedily hear us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To quiet us, let us reflect on what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and enjoy from him, as well as what we miſs: Let us look upon his conceſſions, as well as upon his deferrings or refuſals; and ſet the one againſt the other. If God abridg or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay his people in ſome things, he hears them in
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:169943:251"/> other, yea in many moe and greater matters. It hath been reckoned by the choyceſt of Gods ſervants for a high favor unto them, that in times of great and publique calamities they may eſcape, and have their lives for a prey: ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39.17, 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 45.5. And they ſpeed well if by their prayers they obtain ſo much, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. Yea, and when they may not be vouchſafed that, but that they fall under ſufferings, yet a mercy worthy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting, and tending to the ſatisfying of their ſpirits, it hath been to them, that they have been left undeſtroyed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. Wherefore look we about us, and within us: Do we not eſpy the breakings forth and reſervations of many ſpecial mercies to us in the midſt of the Lords hidings and withholdings (in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) from us? Even in thoſe events which we obſerve falling out directly croſs to the matter of our prayers, we may deſcry the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God alleviating or moderating ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters:<note place="margin">Deſinentes contriſtari propter ea quae non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus, de rehus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentibus gratias a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
                     </note> We may call to mind many particulars wherein it might have been worſe with us; yea, we may find cauſe to admire at ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable intermixtures of favor. When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> complained to God of the miſerable havock that <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel</hi> had made of Religion, and the true worſhippers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it ſeemeth he took and related the caſe to be ſomewhat worſe then it was, when he ſaid, <hi>And I am left alone, and they ſeek my life;</hi> and the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that <hi>yet he had reſerved to himſelf ſeven thouſand men that had not bowed unto
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:169943:252"/> Baal.</hi> We do often with <hi>Elijah</hi> exagerate our miſery, and overlook the mitigations and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we enjoy under croſſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God maketh all occurrences to us, all his Providences to work together for good unto his: That promiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. is immediately ſubjoyned to the doctrine of the Saints prayers: He contriveth ſometimes the weal of his people by ſtops and denyals of their requeſts.

                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, None of the ſervants of God (I may doubtleſs ſay) ſince the world began, have had all their prayers accompliſhed or obtained them at their firſt asking; but in many things they have been either denyed (in the particular asked) or deferred. We have divers inſtances in Scripture of the chief Saints of God denyed in ſome requeſts, which are queſtionleſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recorded, that their examples might qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie us in like caſes. Peruſe at leaſure for this thoſe paſſages of <hi>Moſes, Samuel, David, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Paul: Exod.</hi> 32.32, to the end. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.26. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11, 35. with 16.1. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16, 18. <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.19. with 15.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.8, 9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1. with 11.7.</p>

                  <p>That ſuch there are, and what they are, hath been before endeavoured to be diſcovered.

                  <p>Let me only in a word, exhort, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to a ſincere, and diligent beſtirring in the practiſe of it. Look not at, talk not ſo much of this party, or that deſigne, or the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſe of any among us, as coming betwixt us, and the end of our prayers. No, no, the obſtructers of our prayers are ours, and the Nations ſins; theſe humane occurrences do only obſtruct by vertue of theſe.

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:169943:255"/> defect under our late ſufferings, and ſeekings to God. It was noted of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained after the deſtruction or the Temple, City, and Land by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that <hi>they were not humbled, even unto that day:</hi>

And this is our very ſtate, we have ſought unto God for his conduct in our Affairs, his hand hath been out againſt, and upon us many wayes for our ſins, but for all that we remain unhumbled.

                  <p n="3">3. The third and laſt Direction for the Cure of this evil, is, Let our ſatisfaction be placed and ſought in God himſelf. When the ſtream or rivelet is cut off, or dryed up, the way to help that is to go to the fountain it ſelf. Doth the Lord withhold from us this or that bleſſing which we ask of him? our beſt remedy for that is to ſeek the fruition of God himſelf, his preſence and favor, and to ſatisfie our ſelves, and make up all defects therewith. Whatſoever wants we lie under in reſpect of externals, yea or internals,<note place="margin">Habet om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem omnia. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>
                     </note> all the particulars we lack are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently, yea eminently and tranſcendently to be had in the enjoyment of God; if we have him, we have them, and more.</p>
                  <p>God communicateth himſelf unto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture two ways: Either as an Agent, or as an End; either effectively, or objectively; either by way of operation, or by way of reſt and complacency. Though we have not his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative or effective communications in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of every of thoſe works and events which we think behoveful for us, yet if we have the objective or terminative communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him as our end, reſt, or chiefeſt portion, and good, it is enough. Nay this participation of God is far above the other: He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth himſelf in his acts and operations to all his creatures, but as an end of reſt and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency only to his bleſſed Angels and Saints: That communication is more remote, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate;
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:169943:257"/> that more earthly, this is heavenly; that more reſerved and limited, this is full and ſatisfying.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſtaying upon God by faith, the vertue whereof is to give us the thing we beg for in prayer before it be given us, and whether ever it be brought forth <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> or in a providential courſe, or under a ſenſitive enjoyment, yea or no. Faith giveth us that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in God, and ſuch an aſſurance of the performance of the petitions we ask of him, either in kind, or equivalently, and ſuch a clear foreſight of what is to come, as that however there be a great diſtance, and many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and delays betwixt as and our prayers, yet there is a kind of preſence and poſſeſſion of them unto us.<note place="margin">Joh. 8.56.</note> By it <hi>Abraham ſaw Chriſts day with rejoycing.</hi> By it he and the other Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, before the obtaining of the earthly or heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi>

                  <p>There is in God a full ſtore-houſe and well-ſpring of comforts to make up the defects of whatſoever other things we fail of. If the Lord hide himſelf from us in things ſubſidiary, or ſubſervient, or the means conducing to the end, and not in the main matter, or ultimate end it ſelf, to wit, his favor, Spirit and Kingdom, we may well ſatisfie our ſelves. What we are ſhort of in thoſe intermediate and acceſſive things, we may find and enjoy in God. <hi>David,</hi> when all was taken and gone at <hi>Ziklag,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. God is alway preſent with his, even when they moſt ſeem to be deſerted of him. <hi>Joſeph</hi> through envy was ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but God was with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.9. God was with <hi>David</hi> in his walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. God was with the three children in the fiery furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. And in his preſence is fulneſs of joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. His preſence is Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God ſtill hears his people, even when and while they pray (according to his Will,) though he do not preſently anſwer, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.18. and in hearing he takes exact notice of them and their requeſts, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.34. <hi>Iob</hi> 23.10. and he is dearly affected, tenderly moved with their condition and cry, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.20. and he conſtantly bears in mind them and their prayers: <hi>A Book of remembrance is written for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon his Name,</hi> Mal. 3.16. <hi>They are graven upon the palms of his hands, and their walls are continually before him,</hi> Iſai. 49.16. <hi>The words of their ſupplication are nigh unto the Lord their God day and night,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.59.

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:169943:259"/> 17. This is his mind and diſpoſition towards them even under deſertion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His people have the pledg of his Word and Promiſe to ſtay upon, and move him with. <hi>Remember the word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope: This is my comfort in my affliction; for thy Word hath quickened me,</hi> Pſal. 119.49, 50. Gods word of promiſe is in many reſpects better unto his people then his preſent providential workings: for this is common to the wicked as well as them, and it is temporary and variable; but his Word is eternal and invariable, and the peculiar tenure of his children.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no ſuch ſtrait or difficulty to the people of God, but he hath ſtill a way out for them, though they ſee not the portal or paſſage. That ſpeech of the Apoſtle is excellent to this purpoſe: <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. In In every one of thoſe clauſes they caſt one of their eyes downward upon themſelves, and there ſee their ſtrait; and another upward, to God, and there ſee their outlet: They are, as to their own ſenſe, environed with troubles, as at their wits end, as quite overthrown, they know not which way to turn them for eſcape; but looking up to God, their nonplus is at an end, they know he hath ſtill a poſtern to open for them, and ſet them free.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The people of God have their former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
